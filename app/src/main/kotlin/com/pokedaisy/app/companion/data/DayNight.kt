 * DAY AND NIGHT (SETTINGS > MAKEOVER): the overworld follows the device's clock - a warm dawn, plain day, an orange dusk
 * and a blue night - in any GBA game. It's a tint of the map's palettes and the sprites' as the core draws them
 * ([com.pokedaisy.app.MgbaCore.pkSetTint], pk_wide.c's `tintPalettes`): the text windows' palettes (13-15) keep their
 * colours, nothing of the game's memory or save changes, and EXPAND's margins (drawn from the same palettes) follow.
 * Only outdoors ([outdoors]) and only on the field: the engine eases it in and out ([com.pokedaisy.app.EmulatorEngine.dayNightTint]).
