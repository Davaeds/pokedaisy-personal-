 * The companion made lighter for a slow device (an RG DS report: the game's buttons did nothing after FIGHT until the
 * companion had drawn the move list). The device's buttons reach the game on the UI thread, the one that draws the
 * companion too, so on a weak chip a busy companion leaves the game's presses waiting. While [on]:
 *  - a sample reaches the companion only when something it shows changed, at most every [MIN_UPDATE_MS]
 *    (TelemetryStore; a battle's menu changing always goes through at once);
 *  - its animations are off (CompanionTweaks' icon bounce, map cursor blink, tab slides; the battle pane's crossfade);
 *  - SHADERS > ON COMPANION is off (a shader over every companion view, each frame).
 * AUTO (the default) turns it on for a device that looks weak ([deviceWeak], from its CPU and memory) or once the
 * game's buttons have come late [STRIKES] times within [STRIKE_WINDOW_MS] ([noteKeyDelay]), which is remembered.
 * Compose state, so both screens follow a change at once.
