/**
 * Pokémon HeartGold / SoulSilver's guide (USA). HERE and NEXT BOSS come from [HEARTGOLD_WORLD] / [SOULSILVER_WORLD]
 * (generated from pret/pokeheartgold; the two games' wild Pokémon differ, their trainers don't). NEXT BOSS: the gym
 * leaders by their badges (include/constants/badge.h: the leaders' own trainer flags are cleared again for rematches),
 * the Elite Four by FLAG_DEFEATED_WILL .. KAREN or a cleared game (FLAG_GAME_CLEAR, set when LANCE is beaten), RED by
 * his trainer flag (TRAINER_FLAG_BASE + id).
 * Kanto's gyms can be taken in any order; they're listed in the order the boat and the roads bring you to them.
 *
 * The hand-written pages are from pokeheartgold's scripts (files/fielddata/script/scr_seq), in our own words: the HMs
 * (Ilex Forest's charcoal man once both FARFETCH'D are back; Cianwood after CHUCK; the Dance Theater after its grunt;
 * Route 42's hiker; LANCE in the Rocket HQ after its three ELECTRODE; Route 36's man; an Ice Path 1F item ball; OAK after
 * BLUE), each field move's badge (src/field_move.c), the key items' givers and the blocks: the odd tree (SQUIRTBOTTLE,
 * WHITNEY's badge), Ecruteak's gym (the Burned Tower), JASMINE (the lighthouse, the SECRETPOTION from Cianwood), the Lake
 * of Rage and Rocket HQ (PRYCE's door, Route 43's toll), the Radio Tower (all four of FOG / STORM / MINERAL / GLACIER;
 * BASEMENT KEY, CARD KEY), Mahogany's east road and BLACKTHORN's gym (both after the Radio Tower), the RISING BADGE (the
 * Dragon's Den elder's quiz), the road east of New Bark (the bell, the version's legend), Kanto's Power Plant (MACHINE
 * PART), BLUE (seven Kanto badges, then Cinnabar), Mt. Silver (OAK), the S.S. AQUA (a cleared game, the S.S. TICKET).
