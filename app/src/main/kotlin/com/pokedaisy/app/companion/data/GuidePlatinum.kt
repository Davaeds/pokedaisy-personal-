/**
 * Pokémon Platinum's guide (USA rev 1). HERE and NEXT BOSS come from [PLATINUM_WORLD] (generated from
 * pret/pokeplatinum); the hand-written pages are from its scripts (res/field/scripts) in our own words:
 * - the HMs: Eterna City (CYNTHIA, HM01), the Galactic Warehouse's item ball (HM02), Celestic Town's cave (the elder,
 *   HM03), Iron Island (RILEY, HM04), Solaceon Ruins' item ball (HM05), Oreburgh Gate 1F's hiker (HM06), Sunyshore City
 *   (JASMINE, HM07), Route 217's item ball (HM08);
 * - each field move's badge: field_move_tasks.c's FieldMoves_Check* (PlayerHasRequiredBadge), and which gym gives
 *   which: the gym scripts' GiveBadge;
 * - the blocks: Route 210's PSYDUCK want the SECRETPOTION (CYNTHIA gives it at Valor Lakefront), the Valley Windworks'
 *   WORKS KEY (Floaroma Meadow, once its grunts are beaten), the Veilstone warehouse's STORAGE KEY (a grunt drops it in
 *   Veilstone City once Lake Acuity's events are done: lake_acuity.s shows him), the GALACTIC KEY (an item ball on
 *   Galactic HQ B2F);
 * - key items: the BICYCLE (the Eterna cycle shop's owner, once rescued), the rods (OLD: the gate from Route 218 to
 *   Jubilife City; GOOD: Route 209; SUPER: the Fight Area), the VS SEEKER (Rowan's assistant on Route 207), the
 *   EXPLORER KIT (the Underground Man's house in Eterna City), the POKé RADAR (Prof. Rowan, for a complete Sinnoh Dex).
 * Item ids are pokeplatinum's (generated/items.txt).
