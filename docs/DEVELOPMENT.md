# PokeDaisy - developer notes

How PokeDaisy is built, how each game is read, and how to work on it. For what
the app does and how to install it, see the [README](../README.md).

Dual-screen Android app for the AYN Thor and the Retroid Pocket Duo Lite (its
4:3 1280x960 bottom screen: `DuoLiteCompanionScreenshotTest`; the original Duo
should work too): an embedded **mGBA** core on the top screen + a live-data companion UI
for Gen 3 Pokémon games and ROM hacks on the bottom screen, in one process.
RetroArch-style savestates and speed control on configurable shortcuts.

**Bottom screens.** The companion goes on the first presentation display, or
failing that any other public non-default display (`syncPresentation()`). The
Thor's bottom screen is 1240x1080 (near-square, landscape); the Duo's is 1280x960
(4:3, landscape). Every tab was checked in Compose renders of the Duo's screen
at 320 and 400 dpi; the only layout change it needed is the Settings tab's
compact mode (game name in the title window, tighter rows). Not yet run on a
real Duo, so how its second screen is exposed to apps is still unconfirmed.

See [PLAN.md](../PLAN.md) for the full design and phase breakdown.

## Status: Phase 3 (bottom screen) — data + presentation verified on the Thor

What works:

- `libmgba` (vendored submodule, pinned `0.10.5`) builds for `arm64-v8a` via the
  NDK with all frontends/deps stripped — see [app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt](../app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt).
- JNI bridge [`pokedaisy_jni.c`](../app/src/main/cpp/pokedaisy_jni.c): load ROM,
  attach SRAM, run frames, expose the RGBA framebuffer + interleaved s16 stereo
  audio, take key input, `mCoreSaveStateNamed`/`LoadStateNamed`.
- RetroAchievements: `rcheevos` (vendored submodule, pinned `v12.5.0`) built into the
  same library; [`pokedaisy_ra.c`](../app/src/main/cpp/pokedaisy_ra.c) runs its
  `rc_client` over the player's core (softcore only so far): sign-in in Settings, unlock popups and
  an ACHIEVEMENTS tab on the bottom screen.
- Kotlin shell: `EmulatorView` (GLES2 aspect-fit blit), `EmulatorEngine` (emu
  thread, audio-paced, services savestate requests between frames), `GbaInput`
  (gamepad + keyboard → GBA bitmask), `Hotkeys` (configurable), `SaveStates`
  (per-game CRC folder), `PokeDaisyActivity` (full-screen, ROM auto-discovery,
  HUD).
- **Savestates**: slots 0–9 in `files/states/<rom-crc32>/ss<N>` (mGBA's own
  extended `.ss` format) + a `ss<N>.png` thumbnail. On-screen HUD confirms each
  save/load.
- **Suspend/resume**: backgrounding writes a `resume` state and quitting the loop;
  next foreground boots and loads it (no more fresh-boot-on-resume).
- **Speed control**: hold or toggle fast-forward (capped at 2× by default, Settings > FF SPEED, `EmulatorEngine.ffMaxSpeed`,
  0 = unlimited), a 1×/1.5×/2×/3×/4× cycle, and hold-to-slow-mo (½×). Audio is
  muted at any speed ≠ 1× (proper resampling is Phase 4). Frame pacing is exact
  (measured 90/120/180/240 fps for the cycle steps).
- **Bottom screen**: the Compose companion UI (Party / Map / Items,
  battle panel, mon detail) in `companion/` (it started as a standalone
  Android companion app), shown on the Thor's Screen-2
  via a `DualScreenPresentation`. Its old UDP transport is replaced by
  `InProcessReader` → `MgbaCore.pkReadBytes` (bus reads on the emulator thread,
  ~1×/sec, via `EmulatorEngine.onSample`). Game auto-detect from the ROM header;
  vanilla FireRed and Unbound use native-RAM reads.

Bottom screen confirmed rendering on the Thor's Screen-2; two early crashes
fixed (a `ConcurrentHashMap` null-value NPE on missing sprites, and a Compose
`Dialog` that can't open a window inside a `Presentation` — the mon-detail
popup is now an in-composition overlay). 90 s interaction soak = 0 crashes.
**Rule for this UI: no `Dialog`/`Popup` inside the Presentation.**

## Status: Phase 4 (polish) — in progress

- **Dynamic mon/item icons (done, verified):** `DecompIconSource` decodes party +
  bag sprites straight from the running ROM through `gMonIconTable` /
  `gMonIconPaletteTable` / `gMonIconPaletteIndices` / `gItemIconTable` (`Gfx.kt`
  has the shared 4bpp / LZ77 decoders), falling back to the bundled PNGs.

- **ROM library (done, verified):** `LibraryActivity` is the launcher — pick a
  ROM from `files/roms/`, import one via the system file picker, tap to play,
  "last played" is remembered. In-game, **hold BACK** to return to the library.
- **Library: Recently Played row + Grid view + SteamGridDB cover art (done,
  compiled only — not yet tested on a physical device):** the header's toggle
  switches between the existing list and a tile grid (uniform-size tiles via
  `minLines`/`maxLines` on the title text, so a short name doesn't shrink a
  tile, and a square 1:1 cover ratio matching SteamGridDB's icons — see
  below); a "RECENTLY PLAYED" row (last 3 distinct ROMs played) is the first
  item inside that same scrollable list/grid (not a fixed header above it),
  so it scrolls away with the rest, styled as list rows or tiles to match the
  active view mode.

  Covers are fetched live from [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com)'s
  **icons** endpoint (square, app-icon-style images — not its portrait "grid"
  box art, which looked wrong forced into a compact list row) using a
  **user-supplied key** (Settings > Cover Art — `Prefs.steamGridDbApiKey`) —
  nothing is bundled in the APK; a fetched image is cached under
  `files/covers/` after first use. `SteamGridDbGames.kt` maps
  each **specific ROM hack release** (not just "FireRed vs. Emerald" — most
  hacks share their base game's header code, so that alone can't tell Unbound
  from vanilla FireRed from Radical Red) to a SteamGridDB game ID, keyed by
  the ROM's whole-file SHA1 (`RomIdentity.kt`) — deliberately the _same_ hash
  values `Poller.kt` already uses for live hack detection (both confirmed to
  equal a plain file hash). Covered today: Unbound, Gaia, Radical Red,
  Odyssey, Heart & Soul, Lazarus, R.O.W.E., Emerald Rogue (Amethyst isn't
  catalogued on SteamGridDB yet). Vanilla retail FireRed/LeafGreen/Emerald
  aren't in this table on purpose and fall back to the
  placeholder + manual picker below.

  **Two earlier approaches were tried and reverted before landing here** —
  worth knowing if this ever needs revisiting: (1) booting the ROM headlessly
  and grabbing a live frame reliably landed on an early, uninteresting boot
  frame instead of the title screen (a "boot N frames" heuristic proved too
  fragile); (2) compositing a cover from each game's own decomp title-screen
  source assets (`graphics/title_screen/` in pokefirered/pokeemerald) worked
  correctly but only covers the base games, not the actual ROM hacks this was
  meant to help with, and the user judged the composited result low-quality
  anyway. `hackdex.app` (a ROM-hack-specific cover-art site) was considered
  too, but has site-wide bot-mitigation blocking automated fetches entirely.

  Any ROM not in the SteamGridDB table (or fetched with no API key set yet)
  falls back to the placeholder icon + manual **Set Cover** picker (any
  image, center-cropped to a square); **Reset Cover** re-queues a fetch. A
  manually-set cover is never overwritten by the Refresh-triggered
  backfill pass.

  Tapping **Save** on the API key immediately scans the whole library and
  shows live progress (a bar + a per-ROM outcome log — Fetched / Cached /
  Manual / Not supported / No icon found) right there in Settings, via a
  small shared helper (`CoverArtSync.kt`) also used by Library's Refresh
  backfill — no need to separately go check the Library screen to see
  whether the key actually worked. The key input field is wrapped in a
  `GbaWindow` (cream panel) rather than sitting directly on the screen's
  dark background — its text color is designed for a light panel and was
  barely legible without one. Verified via `./gradlew assembleDebug` +
  `testDebugUnitTest` only.

- **In-app settings (done, verified):** `SettingsActivity` (from the Library) —
  a fast-forward cap stepper and a hotkey list where **Rebind** captures the
  next key/button. Persists to `hotkeys.properties` + prefs; picked up on
  return to the emulator.
- **Fast-forward audio (done):** speeds of 1.5–8× now play sped-up, pitched-up
  audio (sample decimation) instead of silence. Slow-mo and uncapped FF still
  mute.
- **Launcher icon (done):** adaptive icon, no longer the stock Android robot.
- **Per-game default speed (done):** the speed-cycle position is remembered per
  ROM and restored on next launch.
- **Emerald support (done):** `NATIVE_EMERALD` config for vanilla Emerald
  (party / battle / bag / coords via native RAM) + a Hoenn map-section table
  (`MapSecDataEmerald.kt`) and Hoenn region map, so vanilla Emerald
  shows real Hoenn location names and the map.
- **Bottom-screen savestate panel (done):** a "States" tab on the companion —
  a grid of the 10 slots with thumbnails; tap to load, "Save here" to save.
- **On-screen controls (done):** a translucent D-pad + A/B + Start/Select + L/R
  overlay; auto-shown only when no gamepad is connected (Settings →
  "On-screen controls": Auto / Always / Never).
- **OPTION-screen restyle (done, rendered via `ui-preview` only — not yet
  checked on the Thor):** the companion's SETTINGS and STATES tabs and the
  top-screen Library/Settings now share FireRed's OPTION-screen look
  (`companion/ui/GbaMenu.kt`: white title window, grey list window,
  `LABEL  VALUE` rows, white framed buttons) over the game's party-menu
  backdrop; multi-choice settings (FF speed, touch pad, theme) open a pick-list
  instead of cycling. The app's font is now Pixel Operator throughout (Press
  Start 2P removed). The Map tab crops FireRed's black/white region-map border
  and sits in a rounded frame. Savestate thumbnails were being built from a
  _premultiplied_ bitmap fed mGBA's junk 4th byte as alpha, which wrecked their
  colors ("shades" with missing patches); they're now built from the RGB bytes
  directly — slots saved before this keep their old broken thumbnail until
  re-saved. To see UI changes without a device: Paparazzi
  (`make shots`) or [`ui-preview/`](../ui-preview/README.md).
- **Pokémon summary screen (done, `ui-preview` only — not yet on the Thor):**
  tapping a party slot now opens a full-tab summary (`MonDetailScreen.kt`)
  instead of a pop-up: name/gender/level/types/HP top-left, weaknesses /
  resistances / immunities bottom-left, the four moves (type, power, PP, and
  per-foe multipliers in battle) on the right. Square battle-style buttons
  with pixel icons: up/down cycle the party (wrapping), a U-turn arrow goes
  back; the party's icons sit between them and jump on tap. It's one window split by rules
  rather than separate cards.
- **Pixel-art pass (done, `ui-preview` only):** every corner in the app is a
  whole-GBA-pixel staircase (`PixelShapes.kt`) instead of a smooth arc; the
  battle strip's Poké Balls and the loading ball are pixel art; the companion
  tabs use the OPTION-screen look with bigger text; battle buttons and move
  cards have larger text. FireRed/Emerald species, move and item names show in
  the game's capitals (`gameCase()`).
- **Launch fixes (done, `ui-preview` only):** the companion used to keep the
  previous game's backdrop after a launch (it read a global Compose can't
  observe) - snapshots now carry their game and the UI is keyed on it. Until
  the first real data arrives the data tabs show a rocking Poké Ball
  ("LOADING..."); STATES and SETTINGS stay usable meanwhile.
- **Battle INFO / SUGGESTIONS (done, `ui-preview` only):** both are now
  full-tab panes in the Pokémon summary's look (one white window, rules
  between sections, Back bottom-right) instead of an overlay / a cramped
  panel under a "◀ CONTROLS" chip (which, after the tab restyle, had grown to
  fill the whole tab). Move buttons: bigger text, PP bottom-right. Screenshot
  tools now use the Thor's real bottom screen, 1240x1080 landscape.
- **EXP (done for FireRed/Emerald, fixture-tested, not yet on the Thor):** the
  summary shows an EXP bar ("NEXT n" to the next level). It's read from the
  party's own RAM struct (decrypted Growth substruct); thresholds come from the game's growth-rate tables
  (`data/ExpTables.kt`, generated by `scripts/gen_exp_tables.py`).
- **Move advice (the original games so far):** PARTY > a Pokémon's summary >
  LEARN lists its next level-up moves and the TMs / HMs in the bag it can learn,
  each rated LEARN / FORGET <move> / SKIP with its reasons; a TM selected on
  ITEMS shows the party as ABLE / NOT ABLE / LEARNED with the BEST pick. The
  scoring is `data/MoveAdvice.kt` (`MoveAdvisor`, `MoveAdviceTest`); accuracy,
  PP and effects come from `data/MoveStatsGen.kt`, generated by
  `scripts/gen_move_stats.py` from the pinned pokefirered's gBattleMoves.
- **Battle controls, Platinum pass:** big centred FIGHT, BAG / POKéMON in the
  bottom corners with RUN lower between them, INFO / SUGGESTIONS beside the
  six-slot ball strip (grey discs for empty slots), black-outlined buttons with
  a light top band and dark side bands, shadowed labels; the "busy" dots are a
  rocking Poké Ball. INFO and SUGGESTIONS link to each other bottom-left.
- **No bundled sprites (done):** every game now decodes party/bag icons
  straight from the running ROM (retail FR/Emerald
  via fixed addresses from a vanilla decomp build, Unbound via its own reader).
  The ~3 MB `assets/pokemon` + `assets/items` PNG set was removed.
- **No bundled FireRed / Emerald art (done):** their party-menu slot, Poké
  Ball, status icons, small font, party backdrop and the Kanto/Sevii/Hoenn
  region maps are rebuilt from the player's ROM the first time it runs
  (`RomArt`, <1 s in the background) and cached in the app's files. Heart and
  Soul's and the CFRU hacks' party art (`partyhns/`, `partycfru/`, their
  backdrops) followed (2026-10-09): found by fingerprint in their ROMs
  (`HNS_*`, `CFRU_*`, `<hack>_STATUS_GFX` in `scripts/gen_rom_art_sigs.py`),
  pixel-identical to the PNGs that were bundled. Only the fonts are bundled now.
- **Rewind:** tried, reverted — mGBA's non-threaded rewind (a full savestate
  every frame) white-screened the emulator. Revisit with `mCoreThread` or a
  coarse snapshot interval.

Not done yet: Hoenn mapsec table, touch overlay.

## Supported ROMs

The Library (`files/roms/`) can hold any of these; the app auto-detects which
one is running (SHA1 of a live core-memory read for the ROM hacks below, the GBA header's game code (and
revision byte) for plain vanilla FireRed/Emerald/LeafGreen/Ruby/Sapphire — see
`Poller.kt`'s `detect()`) and switches
species/item/map tables and RAM addresses accordingly (`ActiveTables.kt`).

`app/src/test/`, see below; for DEX, checked against the game's own POKéDEX screen) · ⚠️ = wired up but unverified/partial · ❌ = not

Names in French (`UnboundTextFrGen.kt` from `scripts/gen_unbound_fr_tables.py`, a `GameText` over Unbound's own move / map tables, `UNBOUND_FR_TEXT`): species, moves (to 893 - the Max Moves past it keep English's), items, natures, map sections. Item descriptions, dex entries and map names were translated in place, so they read French from the ROM. Its trainers are renamed too (MIRSKLE is Sylvain); the GUIDE's hand-written boss titles stay English. |

On 2026-09-27, headless captures added gMain/SaveBlock1/map header/object events, and the ROM gave its own species/item/move/type/location tables (`*Lazarus.kt`, same generator as Heart and Soul). The "2 extra pockets" were NULL slots. There are 5 real pockets in Emerald order. CARD: Emerald's card code with its own art and font (`LZ_*`), 4 POKéDEX digits, its own count of drawn stars (the HALL OF FAME, flags 0x29 / 0x4A6, the frontier symbols) while the colour follows retail's, and a regional loop that reads one bit past the dex (`TRAINER_CARD_LAZARUS`). |
| **Pokémon SoulGold** v1.1.4, v1.2 | newer `pokeemerald-expansion` (BPEE, 32 MB, gcc), no source available | ✅ (its own plaintext 96-byte struct Pokemon) | ✅ battle mons (0x98-byte BattlePokemon), touch controls - headless scripted wild battle (`soulgold_battle`); trainer battles not checked | ✅ 8 pockets, names + descriptions | ✅ its own Johto map, rebuilt from the ROM (smol art, u16 cursor grid at offset (1, 1)) | ✅ mon + item icons (smol item tiles) | ✅ Johto (702) + National, matched to the game's own POKéDEX | Everything from headless captures of the user's save - see `NATIVE_SOULGOLD`. ROM tables from `gen_expansion_tables.py soulgold`; the bag's night sky is rebuilt from the ROM by `RomArt` (smol tiles + tilemap, `SG_BAG_STARS_*`). STEADY FF music via `M4aSongs`' newer-expansion signature. v1.2 (`NATIVE_SOULGOLD_V1_2`) is a rebuild: v1.1.4's addresses matched into it (literal pools / masked byte runs), checked on the same save headlessly (`soulgold_v12`, `soulgold_v12_battle`); it shares v1.1.4's tables but for TM75 (`soulGoldV12`). A second build also released as v1.2 (sha1 `5d6a0362…`, `NATIVE_SOULGOLD_V1_2B`) keeps every RAM address and battle handler of the first and moves only ROM data (0x98 / 0xA4 bytes); same tables, checked on the same save (`soulgold_v12b`, `soulgold_v12b_battle`). A third v1.2 build (sha1 `2be7c99a…`, `NATIVE_SOULGOLD_V1_2C`) keeps the same RAM and battle handlers too; its ROM data moved 0x18C-0x198 bytes, the wild / map tables 0x2DF30 (new data before them), same tables (`soulgold_v12c`, `soulgold_v12c_battle`). CARD: Emerald's layout with its own smol art and font (`SG_*`), mixed-case words, 7 money / 4 POKéDEX digits, stars for the HALL OF FAME, the regional dex minus legendaries, a Battle Frontier record past 49 and 80 of its 120 achievements (`TRAINER_CARD_SOULGOLD` / `_V1_2`: v1.2 marks six more legendary); money caps at 9,999,999. |
| **Pokémon R.O.W.E.** 2.1.9.1 Experimental | Emerald-based (BPEE, 32 MB), BelialClover's own pokeemerald fork (no expansion), no source for v2.x | ✅ its bit-packed 0x4C-byte struct (`ROWE_PARTY_MON`) | ✅ scripted wild battle captured headless (`rowe_battle`); touch controls, 2-column party grid | ✅ 10 pockets | ✅ its three region maps (Hoenn / Kanto / Sevii, `RW_*`) | ✅ mon + item icons | ⚠️ National (1019), flags matched to the save, not to the game's screen (no POKéDEX on its menu yet) | The ROM's own symbol table (0x08FB0670) names most globals.

Fixed by switching to the one proven stable across 3+ independent captures. Bag hunting (both the Lazarus-style XOR-key pattern search and a raw cross-capture byte-stability scan) didn't converge on a confident candidate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **Pokémon Quetzal** Spanish Alpha 9 v0 | the same engine rebuilt with Spanish dialogue / descriptions / dex text (sha1 `fe346b5b…`) | ✅ English's RAM (`quetzal_es`: six Lv42s) | ✅ scripted wild battle captured headless (`quetzal_es_battle`); its handlers 0x24 before English's | ✅ (3403 Master Balls - the save's own) | ✅ as English | ✅ mon + item icons (its own addresses) | ✅ "POKéMON Semilla", metric | `NATIVE_QUETZAL_ES`: ROM tables mapped from English's through the literal pools (`port_retail.py`'s matching). Quetzal - both releases - carries English, Spanish, Latin American Spanish and Portuguese names and picks them per kind with its own IDIOMA options (START > OPCIONES > TEXTO), kept in SaveBlock2 (+0x2E0..+0x2E2, +0x2F4): `readQuetzalNames`, `QuetzalNamesGen.kt` (`gen_quetzal_tables.py --languages`). Portuguese isn't generated (glyphs past the Western charmap): English there. Money goes past 999,999 (`maxMoney` 9,999,999). |
| **Pokémon Quetzal** Alpha 9 v1, English / Spanish | Alpha 9 v0 rebuilt (sha1 `c108cec7…` / `ff008b70…`): every ROM table moved, v0's RAM | ✅ v0's (`quetzal_v1` / `quetzal_es_v1`: the v0 saves, which v1 loads unchanged) | ✅ scripted wild battles (`quetzal_v1_battle` / `quetzal_es_v1_battle`); its handlers read in each menu, the one-press picks checked (v0's cursors) | ✅ a new record, BAG4 (`Bag4Layout`): v1 rewrites v0's BAG3 into it on load | ✅ as v0 | ✅ mon + item icons (its own addresses) | ✅ as v0 | `NATIVE_QUETZAL_V1` / `_ES_V1`. Every table checked equal to v0's, entry for entry with pointers followed (`gen_quetzal_tables.py --v1`, `QuetzalV1Test`); its only data changes are one move's PP and the Latin American names of Johto's key items (Portuguese in v0, `QuetzalV1Gen.kt`). See below. |
| **Pokémon Quetzal** Alpha 0.8.4, English / Spanish, + Moemon Hotfix builds | the release before Alpha 9 (Hoenn only, 34 map groups); Moemon = the same code with other pictures | ✅ Alpha 9's RAM for the party (`quetzal_084` & co.: Spanish Alpha 9's save, six Lv42s), its own gMain / save pointers | ✅ scripted wild battle captured headless in each (`*_084_battle`); cursors, handlers and the switch checked headless | ✅ vanilla gBagPockets (11 pockets) - the Alpha 9 save's bag is misread by the game itself, our decode matches its bag screen | ✅ Emerald's Hoenn map | ✅ mon + item icons | ✅ caught = seen level 2+ (SEEN 466 / OWN 347, as its dex) | `NATIVE_QUETZAL_V084*`: RAM and ROM through Alpha 9's literal pools, checked across three captures each; tables shared with Alpha 9 by id (`gen_quetzal_tables.py --v084` checks them) but 16 moves.

Species/item name tables extracted **directly from the ROM's own name strings** (`SpeciesNamesAmethyst.kt`/`ItemNamesAmethyst.kt`, same anchor-and-walk technique `gen_unbound_data.py` uses for Unbound): species 1-251 is vanilla National Dex order, 252-~411 is vanilla FireRed's own _internal_ (non-dex) Gen 3 order unchanged, and Amethyst's own Gen 4-8 additions are appended past that non-sequentially (up to id 1267). Icon tables found via Gaia's literal-pool technique — `GetMonIconTiles`/`GetItemIconGfxPtr` are still byte-identical CODE at their exact vanilla rev-0 addresses (the latter's address itself obtained by building the pinned pokefirered commit unpatched and reading its own symbol table, not guessed), just pointing at relocated DATA; both decoded end-to-end into real, recognizable icons (a Tepig, a Potion bottle) as verification, not left to a plausible-looking address alone. `gMonIconPaletteIndices` moved too (0x09C01408; the vanilla table first used was right for Tepig, wrong for 757 species). v1.4.1 (`NATIVE_AMETHYST_V1_4_1`) keeps the RAM (a v1.3.0 save loads, `amethyst_v141` fixture) and vanilla code; its own data moved (literal pools), and 26 Hisuian forms inserted at species 1234 renumber everything after, so it has its own names (`scripts/gen_amethyst_tables.py`, keyed by item slot - the records' itemId field is stale in a few), gender ratios and area data (`GuideId.AMETHYST_V141`), picked by `amethystV141`. |
| **Pokémon Orange Islands** (Beta 5.7 + an unversioned build) | FireRed-based (BPRE rev 0, **16 MB**), retail rev 0 edited in place, no source | ✅ (`orange_islands`) | ✅ scripted wild battle captured headless (`orange_islands_battle`, its CRYSTAL ONIX); retail rev 0's handlers byte for byte, touch input | ✅ | ✅ its Orange Archipelago over FireRed's four screens, from the ROM (`RomRegionMap`) | ✅ retail rev 0's tables | ✅ retail rev 0's tables, edited (`POKEDEX_ORANGE_ISLANDS`) | `NATIVE_ORANGE_ISLANDS`, `GameKind.ORANGE_ISLANDS`. 16 MB like retail, so detect() hashes small BPRE ROMs once too. Its own names, a 24th type CRYSTL (23) with its chart rows, rebalanced moves / base stats: `scripts/gen_orange_islands_tables.py`. The two builds differ in 80 bytes (a line of dialogue and a warp). No CARD: its trainer card is its own art (Ash, four badges). |
| **Pokémon Ultra Violet** v1.22 | FireRed-based (rev 0 code under its own game code **PUVV**, **16 MB**), retail rev 0 edited in place, no source | ✅ (`ultra_violet`) | ✅ scripted wild battle captured headless (`ultra_violet_battle`, a PIDGEY); retail rev 0's handlers, touch input, POKéMON switch (rev 0's party-menu code and RAM unchanged, as in Orange Islands) | ✅ | ✅ FireRed's map byte for byte, a few sections renamed (CATACOMBS, DREAD MOUNTAIN, ...) | ✅ FireRed's tables | ✅ retail rev 0's tables (`POKEDEX_ULTRA_VIOLET`) | `NATIVE_ULTRA_VIOLET`, runs as `GameKind.FIRERED` with `ActiveTables.fireRedHack` (a `HackText`) laying its few renames over the shared tables (`UltraVioletGen.kt` from `scripts/gen_ultra_violet_tables.py`, a diff against retail rev 0: WHITE BALL, LAND DEED, a WATER / DRAGON GYARADOS). Detected by hash on its own code (`TelemetrySampler.HACK_GAME_CODES`, which the library, INFO, the fanfare and the region-map FF watch treat as FireRed). No CARD. |
| **Pokémon FireRed Rocket Edition** | FireRed-based (**BPRE** rev 0, **16 MB**), retail rev 0 edited in place, no source | ✅ (`rocket_edition`: retail FireRed's save boots in it) | ✅ scripted wild battle (`rocket_edition_battle`, SNORLAX Lv100); retail rev 0's handlers, one-press picks (cursors written + A, checked headless), POKéMON switch | ✅ | ✅ FireRed's map byte for byte | ✅ its own NEXT BOSS (ARIANA holds Viridian's badge), its maps' areas | ✅ rev 0's tables, its ability names moved (`POKEDEX_ROCKET_EDITION`) | `NATIVE_ROCKET_EDITION`, `GameKind.FIRERED` with `ActiveTables.fireRedHack` (`RocketEditionGen.kt` from `scripts/gen_firered_hack_tables.py`): its mixed-case text whole (`ownCase`), moves 355..486 (repointed gMoveNames / gBattleMoves), a FAIRY type 23 and its chart. Detected by hash in the small-BPRE check. No CARD. |
| **Pokémon Ash Gray** v4.5.3, Fork Bug Fix v1.0 | FireRed-based (**BPRE** rev 0, **16 MB**), retail rev 0 edited in place, no source | ✅ (`ash_gray`, `ash_gray_fork`: retail FireRed's save) | ✅ scripted wild battles (`*_battle`), as Rocket Edition | ✅ | ✅ its own Kanto and Orange Islands (`RomRegionMap`, `ownRegionMap`) | ✅ NEXT BOSS for the badges won in battle, its own gWildMonHeaders / gMapGroups | ✅ rev 0's tables | `NATIVE_ASH_GRAY` (both builds), `GameKind.FIRERED` with `ActiveTables.fireRedHack` (`AshGrayGen.kt`): a few species slots, 25 moves, key items, the Orange Islands' sections, gender ratios, ELECTRIC on GROUND at half. No CARD. |
| **Pokémon Prism** v0.95 build 254 (Hotfix 5) | Crystal-engine hack (GBC, 2 MB, RainbowDevs: Naljo and Rijon), no source or symbols (sha1 `75207669…`) | ✅ Crystal's struct, its own 254 species ids (`prism`: a new game played headless) | ⚠️ both battlers (`prism_battle`), LEADER JOSIAH's two (`prism_trainer`, started through its own script code); touch controls on Crystal's 2D menu (a move and RUN checked headless) | ✅ its bigger pockets (40 items, 25 balls, 50 key items) and a bit per TM / HM | ✅ its own 113 landmarks and 450 maps from the ROM, its six town maps (`Gen2Art`); no player head (six models) | ✅ its own per-species icons (LZ, 8 OBJ palettes) | ✅ its own list of 253 in its order, pages and pictures read through its text engine (`PrismDexTest`) | `GEN2_PRISM`, `GameKind.PRISM`.

| **Sword and Shield Ultimate Plus** v1.2.1.2 (+ Casual / Performance patches) | FireRed-based CFRU hack (BPRE rev 0, **32 MB**), no source | ✅ (`sword_shield_up`) | ✅ scripted wild battle captured headless (`sword_shield_up_battle`, a WOOLOO); rev 0's battle RAM and stored handler addresses, touch input (no POKéMON switch: unverified party menu) | ✅ | ✅ Galar from the ROM (`RomRegionMap`; FireRed's Sevii screens, junk in its tiles, dropped) | ✅ its own (CFRU tables via FireRed's literal pools) | ✅ one national dex 1-898 (`POKEDEX_SWORD_SHIELD`, Unbound's CFRU flags) | `NATIVE_SWORD_SHIELD`, `GameKind.SWORD_SHIELD`. Names / types / moves / items / gender / map names: `scripts/gen_cfru_tables.py sword_shield` (13-byte move names, no long-name table). Party menu rebuilt from the ROM (CFRU's tiles in its own palette: `partyswsh/`, `partybg/swsh_tile.png`), bag sampled headless (`SwordShieldBag`). Its Casual / Performance / Casual and Performance patches (sha1 daa2f899… / 4858cc3d… / 932323d1…) share every table and the RAM: the base save and a battle decode in each (`sword_shield_up_casual*`, `_performance*`). No CARD. |
| **Pokémon GS Chronicles** v2.7.6 | FireRed-based CFRU hack (BPRE rev 0, **32 MB**, Ruki Studios), no source | ✅ (`gs_chronicles`, `gs_chronicles_swapped`: a new game played headless - retail FireRed's save is "deleted" by it) | ✅ scripted wild battle captured headless (`gs_chronicles_battle`, a SENTRET; its script at 0x0203F400, the hack uses 0x0203FF00); rev 0's battle RAM and handlers, FireRed's cursors (one-press picks), the POKéMON switch on CFRU's grid - each checked headless | ✅ | ✅ Johto and Kanto from the ROM (`RomRegionMap`; its other two screens are FireRed's Sevii tilemaps in its tiles, dropped). Johto's boxes match the map; Kanto's are the hack's own (they don't line up with its towns) | ✅ its own (CFRU tables via FireRed's literal pools; Odyssey's status icons) | ✅ its 501-entry Johto list (`POKEDEX_GS_CHRONICLES`, CFRU's flags), NATIONAL once FireRed's unlock byte is set | `NATIVE_GS_CHRONICLES`, `GameKind.GS_CHRONICLES`. Names / types / moves / items / gender / map names: `scripts/gen_cfru_tables.py gs_chronicles` (17-byte move names; gItems keyed by slot - its `.itemId` is often a copied 374). Party menu: CFRU's shared slots and grid from the ROM (`partycfru/`), bag sampled headless (`GsChroniclesBag`). Species are DPE's ids, so without its own config it reads SURE as Unbound (BestEffortTest's siblings). No CARD (its trainer card is its own art). |

Nothing is at a retail address: RAM from headless captures (party / count / save blocks / gMain / map header / objects / bag / battle block, each a literal-pool word, reference counts in the config's comment), ROM tables from the GF ROM header at 0x08000100 and by content. v1.9.x moved EWRAM past 0x02005000 up 8 bytes and v1.9.7 the save-block pointers up 0x1C; the battle block and gMain stayed. FireRed's species / move ids, types, gender ratios, growth rates and type chart (the generator checks them by hash); its own names (title-cased moves and items, 409 item slots: Mints, Bottle Caps, LINKING CORD, DexNav, ...), `scripts/gen_recharged_yellow_tables.py`. CARD: FireRed's art under its own card code - its player pictures and font (`RY_*`), its strings and Emerald-style placement, plain game stats, stars for the HALL OF FAME / its 37 achievements / Kanto / 1-248 + 252-384, six Pokémon icons on the back (`TRAINER_CARD_RECHARGED_YELLOW_*`; v1.9's red is lighter: `CardStyle.RECHARGED_YELLOW_V1_9`). |

**Pokémon Quetzal Alpha 9 v1** (English / Spanish; `NATIVE_QUETZAL_V1` / `NATIVE_QUETZAL_ES_V1`) is Alpha 9 v0 rebuilt (28 of its
32 MB differ). How it was ported, for the next release:
- **RAM**: v0's. Every RAM word in v0's literal pools maps to the same word in v1's code (`port_retail.py`'s `map_literal`,
  English v0 -> v1 and Spanish v0 -> v1), and the v0 saves load in v1 unchanged (`quetzal_v1`, `quetzal_es_v1`). v1 sets three
  more bits of the party struct's byte 0x1B, which nothing here reads.
- **ROM tables**: v0's addresses through the same literal pools, then each table compared with v0's entry for entry, a pointer
  counting as equal when what it points at is (pages, pics, palettes, footprints, learnsets, trainer parties, wild slots).
  Kanto's trainer table (no literal pool) by its records with the party pointer masked. `gen_quetzal_tables.py --v1` checks the
  names (every language), species data, pockets, chart, moves' power / type and map sections: v1 changed one move's PP and
  corrected the Latin American names of Johto's key items (v0's were Portuguese) - `QuetzalV1Gen.kt`, laid over by
  `quetzalV1`. Spanish v0's config had read English's evolution and learnset addresses: it has its own now.
- **Battle handlers**: read in gBattlerControllerFuncs (0x03005580) in each menu of a scripted wild battle (setwildbattle
  through v1's ScriptContext_SetupScript, 0x080DE341 English / 0x080DE359 Spanish); Spanish's are English's - 0x24, as in v0.
  The target handler (doubles only) is v0's function, one local more. The cursors are v0's (RIGHT / DOWN walk 0 -> 1 -> 3, a
  written 2 + A opened the party menu).
- **The bag** is a new record, `BAG4` (`Bag4Layout`): read off the game's code (the check at 0x08144F88, its byte accessor
  0x08142D40, the entry reader 0x08142F7C, the item / key-item lookups 0x081431E8 / 0x08143304 in English v1). Per campaign
  (byte 5: the current of three) 10 pockets of 22-bit entries (an index into the pocket's ROM list of item ids + quantity XOR
  the key) and up to 128 key items (a byte each: an index into the 11th list). v1 writes a v0 save's BAG3 into it as it loads:
  the same items, quantities and key items, in v1's pocket order. Its lists sit in the ROM, so a RAM-only fixture reads no bag.
- **Not done**: EXPAND and the field reads (v0's are by ROM CRC), WILD ENCOUNTERS (not found, as v0).

**Pokémon Recharged Yellow** (Jaizu; four releases, `NATIVE_RECHARGED_YELLOW_*`) is pokefirered
rebuilt with modern gcc, so nothing sits where retail has it and FireRed's literal-pool tricks
(`RomRegionMap`, retail ports) don't apply. What was found, and how:
- **Every release from one save**: v1.9.0 / v1.9.4 / v1.9.7 load the v1.8.0 save as is (same party
  bytes, money, place), so each release has a field and a battle fixture of the same game; the addresses
  were ported through v1.8.0's literal pools and then read in each release's own captures.
- **Its GF ROM header** (0x08000100, pokefirered's `struct GFRomHeader`) names the icon tables,
  gSpeciesNames, gBaseStats, gItems, and SaveBlock1's own layout: party count +0x3B, party +0x44,
  flags +0xEFB, vars +0x1028. Money (+0x29C) and bag quantities are plain: the hack dropped the
  encryption key (a new game's money reads 3000 raw), so `encryptionKeyOff = -1`.
- **Trainers** are 0x24-byte records with two parties - NORMAL (size in the low nibble of +0x1F) and HARD
  (+0x20, the high nibble), picked by SaveBlock2+0x6E0 (its difficulty) - of 0x20-byte TrainerMons
  (`GuideTables.trainerHardPartyOff`). Its system flags moved (badges 0x880.., game clear 0x864); trainer
  flags (0x500 + id) and FLAG_DEFEATED_* are FireRed's; its hidden-item flags aren't (1000 + n reads set for islands the
  save never reached) and their base wasn't found, so HERE lists hidden items unmarked (`--no-hidden-flags`).
- **Area data**: `gen_guide_areas_rom.py` with `--items` (its 48-byte gItems, key pocket 6), `--ops` (the
  sizes of its script commands 0xD5..0xE9 and of the vanilla ones it changed - `message` carries one text
  per language, 25 / 29 bytes - read off each handler's ScriptRead* calls; 0xE3 is variable-length and
  stops a path) and `--max-species 412`. Each release moved items and gifts, so each has its own file.
- **Languages**: the game has a text-language option (SaveBlock2+0x91, low 5 bits; 6 languages, 7 in
  v1.9.7) and carries other languages' name tables after its English ones (French species, Portuguese
  moves). The companion shows the English names. Best effort can't be SURE of it for the same reason
  (no config's names "cover" a ROM that holds French species too), but ranks its own config first.
- **Music**: its song table is ordered like Emerald's (610 songs; FANFARE_LEVEL_UP is 367), so the
  renderer knows it by the GF header's SaveBlock1 size (`isRechargedYellowRom`) for the fanfare and
  renders all its BGM rather than FireRed's map-music list. `RegionMapWatch` reads sRegionMap two pool
  words before the 0x4796 offset there (gcc put another global between them).

**Pokémon Recharged Emerald** (Jaizu, like Recharged Yellow; v2.2.5, v2.2.8 and Rebalanced v2.2.8, `NATIVE_RECHARGED_EMERALD_*`)
is pokeemerald rebuilt with modern gcc, Recharged Yellow's recipe applied to Emerald: nothing at a retail address, but Emerald's
species / move / item ids, type ids and type chart, so it runs as `GameKind.EMERALD` with its own names laid over the shared
tables (`ActiveTables.emeraldHack`, a `HackText` like the FireRed hacks'; `scripts/gen_recharged_emerald_tables.py`). What was
found, and how:
- **No save of its own**: retail Emerald's loads, but RE's SaveBlock1 differs past the bag, so the menu lost POKéMON / POKéDEX and
  Rebalanced hung on CONTINUE. `scripts/convert_save_recharged_emerald.py` rewrites the save into its layout (both slots, checksums
  over its own sizes); the converted saves sit next to RetroArch's under each build's name, and boot cleanly in all three.
- **Its save layout**, from its GF ROM header (0x08000100: flags / vars / party offsets, the bag counts, the save block sizes) and
  SetBagItemsPointers: Items 60 slots at +0x560, Key Items 50 at +0x650, Poké Balls 32 at +0x718, TMs and Berries as retail at
  +0x798 / +0x898, the seen1 copy dropped, flags +0x1344 and vars +0x1470 (+0xD4), a Medicine pocket (50) in retail's
  unused_3598 at +0x366C, the seen2 copy dropped and 0x30 new bytes at the end (0x3DA0). SaveBlock2 has 0x1C more bytes at its end.
  Rebalanced puts 4 more bytes in front of both blocks (its header's offsets are all 4 higher): `saveBlock1PosOff` 4,
  `playerGenderOff` 0xC, money +0x494, the key +0xB0, the dex at SaveBlock2+0x1C.
- **RAM** from headless dumps of the converted save (party / save blocks / gMain / map header / objects / bag, each checked against
  its literal-pool reference count) and of a scripted wild battle through each build's ScriptContext_SetupScript (the function that
  loads gScriptCmdTable, 233 commands: six more than retail). The battle globals are Recharged Yellow's order 8 bytes lower.
- **ROM tables**: the header gives the icon tables, names, gBaseStats, gItems (Recharged Yellow's 48-byte records) and
  gBattleMoves; the Pokédex and guide tables are retail Emerald's shapes found by their bytes (dex entries by BULBASAUR's,
  learnsets by its list, trainers by ROXANNE's record: all 855 names sit at retail's ids). Rebalanced's wild headers are 0x24
  bytes (land, a second land table, water, rock smash, fishing at slots 0, 1, 2, 4, 6), found through the code that loads v2.2.8's.
- **Its art** is recompressed (another LZ77 encoder, so none of Emerald's fingerprints match: RomArt keys on the compressed
  bytes) and partly redrawn, so it has fingerprints of its own (`RE_*`, `gen_rom_art_sigs.py`), the same bytes in all three
  builds. Found headless: the party menu's VRAM and palette RAM matched against every LZ77 stream in the ROM (the backdrop's 80
  tiles, its palette and status palette; the tilemap and status icons are Emerald's data recompressed, the slot tilemaps and
  Poké Ball Emerald's bytes), FONT_SMALL by retail's glyphs (it widened 0x30-0x33 and one symbol: `RechargedEmeraldPartyStyle`), the
  Hoenn map and the two map heads from region_map.c's literal pools. RomArt writes them to `partyre/`, `partybg/recharged_emerald.png`,
  `regionmap/recharged_emerald.png` and `player_brendan_re` / `player_may_re`; the map keeps Emerald's boxes and cursor grid (the
  same layout). Its bag screen keeps Emerald's palette in the app.
- **FIELD items** (USE / GIVE / TAKE): no retail function is where retail has it, so `scripts/find_field_items_recharged_emerald.py
  <v2.2.5> <v2.2.8> <Rebalanced>` finds each one through the code that calls it and writes `FieldItemsRechargedEmeraldGen.kt`,
  which each config carries (`NativeConfig.fieldItems`). VarGet and the bag functions come from gScriptCmdTable's additem /
  removeitem / checkitem handlers; VarSet and the Repel's variables from Task_UseRepel (reached from a Repel's fieldUseFunc through
  its tasks' literal pools); GetMonData, ExecuteTableBasedItemEffect, gPartyMenu / gPlayerParty and gItemEffectTable from
  ItemUseCB_Medicine (a Potion's fieldUseFunc stores it in gItemUseCB); SetMonData as the function called most with
  MON_DATA_HELD_ITEM and a stack buffer; ArePlayerFieldControlsLocked from script.c's Lock / Unlock / IsLocked trio. What it
  changed from pokeemerald: struct Item lost itemId (48 bytes with name[18], holdEffectParam at 0x15, pocket 0x1E, fieldUseFunc
  0x20; pockets 1 Items, 2 Medicine, 3 Poké Balls, 4 TMs, 5 Berries, 6 Key Items); nine struct Pokemon fields of its own sit before
  MON_DATA_ENCRYPT_SEPARATOR (19), so SPECIES is 20, HELD_ITEM 21, MOVE1 22, PP1 26, IS_EGG 54, STATUS 64, HP 66 (GetBoxMonData's
  `cmp r1, #19` and SetMonData's `subs r3, #64` agree); its Repel also zeroes its Lure's 0x4055 / 0x404E and writes the item to
  0x4052 for the wore-off prompt. Checked headless on each build from the converted save: a Repel through those VarSets (100, then
  95 after a walk), a Potion / Antidote / Ether / Elixir / PP Up after SetMonData damage, the no-effect dry run (EWRAM identical
  after the 100 bytes went back, IWRAM only the call's stack), GIVE / TAKE through the scratch word, an in-game save from the START
  menu and a reboot from the `.srm` with every change kept and no bad egg.
- **Not done**: EXPAND (its object events are expansion's layout and its overworld sprites load their tiles at run time:
  gSprites' image pointers are null, which WIDE's far-off objects rely on), FLY and the CARD. FF music isn't checked on it.

**Pokémon Red and Blue** (Game Boy; `GEN1_RED` / `GEN1_BLUE`, `GameKind.RED` / `.BLUE`): pret/pokered builds both carts
byte for byte (`pokered.gbc` / `pokeblue.gbc`, its roms.sha1), and the two keep every RAM address and every table the
companion reads at the same place with the same bytes; the user has a Red cart, Blue is checked on the build. What differs
from Yellow:
- **RAM**: Yellow's plus one byte from wOnSGB (CF1B) up; the menus (wTopMenuItemY, wMoveMenuType, wPlayerMonNumber) and
  wTileMap below it, and the audio RAM, didn't move. The battle menu's cursor columns are Yellow's (9 / 15).
- **Tables**: every one `gen_gen1_tables.py` reads (species order, names, types, moves, items, chart, maps) comes out as
  Yellow's (`red` / `blue` check it and write nothing), so the app keeps one set. Yellow's hand-written item text fits them.
- **A Super Game Boy**: an SGB-enhanced cart that isn't a Color one runs as a Super Game Boy in mGBA (model 0x20), so its
  colours are the SGB palettes the game sends (pokered's data/sgb): the windows' white is 0xFFEFFF, black 0x181010
  (`OptionColors.gbPaper` / `gbInk`), the party menu PAL_MEWMON through OBP0 and PAL_GREENBAR / YELLOWBAR / REDBAR, the town
  map PAL_TOWNMAP (its sprite through OBP0: the player is white / light blue / black) - all sampled headless.
- **Art** (`Gen1Art.RED` / `.BLUE`, one set of files): pokered's addresses; 14 icon loads a frame (no PIKACHU shape).
- **DEX**: their own pages (Yellow rewrote the text) and SGB palettes (`SuperPalettes`, the same format as CGBBasePalettes);
  MEW was added last, so its base stats (`MewBaseStats`) and pics sit in bank 1 (`Gen1DexTables.mewBaseStats`).
- **STEADY FF music**: Yellow's sound engine and audio RAM, their own PlayMusic (0x23A1) and songs (bank 0x1F's ids from
  INTRO_BATTLE on are one lower; no bank 0x20). Bank 0 holds no `18 FE` to park on, so the render core parks on WRAM:
  `pkRenderGbPark` writes `jr @` at 0xCD39 (wUnusedSimulatedJoypadStatesMask, written by the main loop, never read) first
  (mgba_dump's `gbpark` too). Route 1 loops at 22.9 s, the wild battle at 31.3 s after 13.1 s: Yellow's numbers.
- **Saves**: the user's Red save (Yellow's team, Nelson) loads in Blue, but its map's tileset pointers are Red's, which
  Blue keeps 0x10 lower, so Blue draws that Pokémon Center as garbage (`native-capture/boot/blue.txt` pokes Blue's pointers
  in for the fixtures). Not the companion's concern: what it reads is right either way.

**Pokémon Crystal** (Game Boy Color; `GEN2_CRYSTAL`, `GameKind.CRYSTAL`): pret/pokecrystal builds every English
release byte for byte (`make crystal crystal11 crystal_au` with rgbds 1.0.4, its roms.sha1), and the three keep every RAM
address and every table the companion reads at the same place (their .sym files differ only in code). What's Gen 2's own:
- **WRAM banks**: the game state sits in WRAM bank 1 (D000-DFFF), and the game switches D000 to other banks mid-frame
  (palettes in bank 5, the battle's scratch), so a bus read between frames can land on the wrong bank (seen headless: a peek
  of wBattleMode read 0 in a battle). `Gen2Reader` gives D000-DFFF addresses as `wramx(bank, addr)` = (bank << 16) | addr,
  which the native `pkReadBytes` reads from that bank directly (`pk_gb_read_banked`) and `FixtureMemoryReader` from
  mgba_dump's `wramx.bin` (all 8 banks, written beside wram.bin for a Color cart).
- **A new game, played headless**: the user had no Crystal save, so one was played in rev 1 with mgba_dump's new
  `savestate` (and `loadstate`) in steps: name CHRIS, CHIKORITA, the lab's POTION, a PIDGEY caught on ROUTE 29 with Poké
  Balls poked into the bag, a BERRY poked onto CHIKORITA, saved through the START menu. That save loads unchanged in rev 0
  and Australia (`crystal_rev0`, `crystal_au`). Gen 2 can miss a one-frame press outside its menus: hold buttons 3 frames.
- **Gender** is the party menu's GetGender: female while (Attack DV << 4 | Speed DV) is at most BaseData's ratio.
- **Art** (`Gen2Art`, like `Gen1Art`, keyed by SHA1): the font (`Font`, 1bpp), party icons (8 2bpp tiles per icon id,
  `MonMenuIcons`, in `PartyMenuOBPals`' palette: every icon is that red), `HeldItemIcons`, the POKéGEAR maps (`JohtoMap` /
  `KantoMap` over the LZ `TownMapGFX`, palettes by `TownMapPals.PalMap` from `MalePokegearPals`; matched headless against
  the POKéGEAR's map card, the map card flag poked on to see it) and CHRIS / KRIS (the walking sprite's first frame in day's
  red / blue). A landmark's coordinates are the POKéGEAR icon's centre in screen pixels, so the maps are drawn at (0, 0).
- **DEX** (`Gen2Dex`, from the cart like `Gen1Dex`): `PokedexDataPointerTable` (a bank per 64 entries), pics by
  `PokemonPicPointers` through `FixPicBank.PicsBanks` (the stored bank is an index from "Pics 1" plus PICS_FIX), Gen 2's
  LZ (`Gen2Lz`), placed in the 7x7 box as PadFrontpic does, coloured with `PokemonPalettes`. Item descriptions come from
  `ItemDescriptions`, a TM's from its move (`TMHMMoves` -> `MoveDescriptions`), as PrintItemDescription does.
- **Not done**: GUIDE, STEADY FF music (Gen 2's sound engine isn't Gen 1's: STEADY plays the game's audio sped up), the
  POKéMON switch, a trainer-battle fixture, the TRAINER CARD.

**Pokémon Gold and Silver** (Game Boy Color; `GEN2_GOLD` / `GEN2_SILVER`, `GameKind.GOLD` / `.SILVER`): pret/pokegold
builds both carts byte for byte (`pokegold.gbc` / `pokesilver.gbc`, its roms.sha1), and the two keep every RAM address at the
same place (their .sym files agree on all of WRAM / HRAM). What differs from Crystal:
- **RAM**: every address its own (pokegold.sym), the structs and menus Crystal's; wBattleMon, wCurOTMon and wCurBattleMon sit
  in bank 0. No gender choice (`playerGender = -1`: the boy).
- **Tables**: one set for both (`gen_gen2_tables.py gold_silver`, the two ROMs checked byte for byte); species, moves, types
  and chart are Crystal's (`--base`), items Crystal's less the four Crystal filled in (CLEAR BELL, GS BALL, BLUE CARD, EGG
  TICKET), landmarks one fewer (no BATTLE TOWER: from ROUTE 40 on, one id below Crystal's).
- **Art** (`Gen2Art.GOLD` / `.SILVER`, one set of files): Crystal's pixels from their own addresses (Silver's icon tables sit
  0x1A bytes before Gold's); the party menu and PACK are Crystal's colours, pixel for pixel in both versions (sampled headless).
- **DEX**: each version's own pages (`POKEDEX_GOLD` / `POKEDEX_SILVER`, two objects so a cache never crosses them).
  GetDexEntryPointer computes the page's bank (64 species a bank from 68:4000: `Gen2DexTables.dexEntryFirstBank`), and
  FixPicBank is a table of {stored, real} bank pairs (`picBankFixes`), not Crystal's PicsBanks index.
- **A new game, played headless** in Gold (the user had none): GOLD, CYNDAQUIL, the aide's POTION, a PIDGEY caught on ROUTE 29
  with Poké Balls poked into the bag, a BERRY poked onto CYNDAQUIL; the same file loads in Silver. mgba_dump's `loadstate` left
  this cart's PACK listing "?" items (RAM identical), so the save and fixtures come from single runs fed commands live. Gold's
  hROMBank is FF9F (`gbfar` writes Crystal's FF9D) and its FarCall takes a = bank, hl = address (`gbinject`'s trampoline is
  Crystal's): `gold_trainer`'s README has the trainer battle's workaround (a 15-byte trampoline poked over it).
- **Not done**: GUIDE, STEADY FF music, the TRAINER CARD (as Crystal).

**Pokémon Crystal Clear** (Game Boy Color; ShockSlayer's open-world hack of Crystal; `GameKind.CRYSTAL_CLEAR`,
`GEN2_CRYSTAL_CLEAR_V2_6_0` / `_V2_5_11`): v2.5.11 and v2.6.0, each released as a Standard Colors and a Color Filter build.
The two builds of a version are the same code byte for byte but for ~9,400 bytes of palettes (and the header checksum), so
they share everything; the two versions share the RAM and nearly every ROM table. It is pokecrystal grown and rebuilt with
no symbol file (3% of bank 0 is where Crystal has it), so:
- **RAM**: `scripts/port_gen1.py` (generalised from the Yellow ports: any pret .sym into another build) maps
  pokecrystal11.sym by the code that uses each symbol: `port_gen1.py --loose pokecrystal11.sym crystal11.gbc cc.gbc
  wPartyCount wMapGroup ...` (`--loose` masks `ld a,n` and `jr` operands, `--window N` narrows the code compared).
  Everything the companion reads stayed but wMapGroup / wMapNumber (moved into bank-1 bytes Crystal leaves unused, DA3A;
  wYCoord / wXCoord stayed at DCB7, hence `Gen2Config.coords`) and wPokedexCaught (DA0E; wPokedexSeen stayed). Each was then
  checked in dumps (the map ids following the player through three maps, the caught bits after a catch). wPlayerGender's
  byte is still read, but the hack picks a gender (MALE / FEMALE / NONE) apart from the character's look, and nothing in the
  companion uses it there.
- **Crystal's save doesn't fit**: its map ids sit where Crystal Clear keeps other things, so CONTINUE lands on a broken map
  and overwrites WRAM. A new game was played headless in v2.6.0 (`savestate` / `loadstate` in steps; NORMAL mode, NEW BARK
  TOWN, the character screen's DONE, BULBASAUR, MOM's battle, a SENTRET caught on ROUTE 29) and saved in game; it loads in all
  four builds. Hold presses 6 frames in its menus (3 were dropped at times).
- **ROM tables** (gen_gen2_tables.py `crystal_clear`, every table checked the same in all four builds): found by their
  contents where Crystal's bytes survived (base data, moves, type chart, font, the town maps and their palettes, dex
  banks, pic banks, TM moves) and by the code that reads them otherwise (port_gen1.py's votes, or the routine by hand:
  the party icons at 23:6F3C, IsInJohto at 00:3060). Its species, base data, moves, types and type chart equal Crystal's
  (`--base` checks them and they aren't written again); its item names (16 renamed: REGION MAP, HOUSE KEY, DEX TRACKER, new
  balls...), 117 landmarks (21 past FAST SHIP) and 26 map groups (488 maps, no decomp: a group runs to the next group's
  pointer, the last one while its entries look like headers) are its own.
- **Its text is packed**: PlaceNextChar looks bytes 0x16-0x5F up in a table of 3-byte entries at 00:11FF (0 + a bank-0
  string such as "with " or "#MON", or 1 + a routine: line breaks, the player's name). Move names, dex pages and
  descriptions use it; the generator and `Gen2Dex` (`Gen2DexTables.textDict`) expand it.
- **Regions**: its RegionCheck gives a landmark past FAST SHIP the region of a stand-in landmark from a table (72:6F8B,
  one entry short: ORIGIN PLAINS reads the code after it and is on no map here).
- **Art** (`Gen2Art.CRYSTAL_CLEAR_V2_6_0` / `_V2_5_11`, into paths of its own that the art is rebuilt into whenever
  another of its builds starts, the Color Filter's colours included): a party icon per species, LZ-compressed, by Dex
  number from 23:7019 in bank 0x1B / 0x1D below / from species 0x80 (v2.5.11: 0x1C / 0x1E), UNOWN's by letter, coloured
  with the species' two icon colours (02:622C, 8 bytes each) over black; the town maps in the default RED POKéGEAR's
  colours (the player picks the gear's and the PACK's colours at the start). No player head: the character is the player's
  own model and colours.
- **Not done**: GUIDE, the POKéMON switch, the CARD, STEADY FF music (as Crystal), its own trainer data, and its features
  (the Nuzlocke mode, following Pokémon, the character's own look).

**Pokémon Prism** (Game Boy Color; RainbowDevs' Crystal-engine hack with its own regions, Naljo and Rijon, plus parts
of Johto, Kanto, the Sevii Islands and Tunod; `GameKind.PRISM`, `GEN2_PRISM`): v0.95 build 254 (Hotfix 5), the final
release. No source or symbol file, and much more changed than Crystal Clear, so:
- **The "patched Crystal"**: a second file the user had, named as a patched Crystal (`Pokemon - Crystal Version (USA)
  (patched).gbc`, sha1 `3569e15d…`), calls itself "LOL PRISM" in its header. It is Crystal rev 0 with its first two
  banks (32 KB) replaced by a ROM-only program that fills the screen with "LOL" tiles and halts: no game to read, left out.
- **RAM**: `scripts/port_gen1.py --loose` with pokecrystal11.sym put nearly everything at Crystal's addresses (party,
  map ids and coordinates, wBattleMode, both battle_structs, wOTParty*, the 2D menu, the tilemap, money D84E, game time).
  The bag moved and grew: wTMsHMs D859 is 13 bytes of bits (TM01-96, HM01-05: Prism's TMs are reusable, FlagAction on
  it at 0B:48DC; the TM pocket matched a poked bit), the pockets follow at D866 (40 items), D8B8 (50 key items), D8EC
  (25 balls) and D920 (PC, 60) - ReceiveItem's capacities (12:437D). Caught / seen stayed at DE99 / DEB9, 32 bytes each
  (254 species fit). Every address was then checked on headless dumps.
- **A new game, headless**: Crystal's and Crystal Clear's saves both boot to "The save file is corrupted!". The intro
  runs on its own (clock, model, name), then the father's camp, the path down to a mine cart that takes the player into
  ACQUA MINES. The story there gives no Pokémon and locks the START menu and wild encounters (D84C bit 5, checked at
  25:54F2), so mgba_dump grew `gbfar` (call a banked routine between frames, registers put back) to run the game's own
  TryAddMonToParty (3C:4000, found by Crystal's code) and ReceiveItem (00:12E5), `gbpoke` for banked WRAM, `gbvdump`
  for the Color palettes / OAM, and `gbinject` (make the game call a routine from its frame wait, interrupts on) to
  start LEADER JOSIAH's battle through its own loadtrainer / startbattle (25:611B / 25:614A). The bit was cleared to walk
  until a wild SHINX came (caught) and to save, then set again at the save prompt: the save holds the game's own value.
- **ROM tables** (gen_gen2_tables.py `prism`, each found by the code that reads it, listed in GAMES["prism"]): species
  names (10 bytes, 05:55E5), BaseData shrunk to 24 bytes (14:5A0E: Crystal's first 24, no TM bits), moves (10:5263, 7
  bytes, the category in the type's top two bits), move and item names as a length byte then the text (11:61BC,
  11:4000), TypeNames' pointers (13:53DA: Fairy 10, Gas 11, Sound 13, Tri 14, Prism 15), a type chart of 2-bit cells
  (0D:7AC4, 7 bytes per attacking type: 0 none, 1 half, 2 normal, 3 double - BattleCheckTypeMatchup at 0D:5C0E),
  TMHMMoves (04:53A4, GetTMHMMove), landmark names (09:67EF) placed by each region's town map grid (09:6638: LZ, 18 x 15
  cells, bit 7 on the cell its dot is drawn at, 09:656F), 95 map groups (25:4000). Its growth rates add two Crystal lacks
  (6, 7): `expProgress` covers the four Gen 3 shares.
- **Art** (`Gen2Art.PRISM`): party icons LZ per species by a {bank, address} table (1C:77CE), each in one of the 8 OBJ
  palettes at 02:6079 its byte in 23:7BEB picks (high nybble; the low one is the shiny's: 23:7D42), traced with
  `gbvdump` on the party menu; the font at 3D:720D; six town maps (LZ tilemaps of 20 x 17 drawn from the second row,
  23:4F3C; LZ tiles 41:4210; the palette map 23:5151; BG palettes 02:6129), matched against the map screen headless
  (opened with `gbinject C002 23 4dd6 0f4e`) pixel for pixel but for its sprites and blinking dots.
- **DEX** (`GEN2_DEX_PRISM`, `POKEDEX_PRISM`), found from DisplayDexEntry (02:79C1, by the "No." tiles Crystal's places):
  GetDexEntryPointer (02:7ADA) takes a word per species at 02:7B1B, in the bank 00:081D names per 64 species. A page is
  the category, then (where its text's done left off: wc2d0) height in decimetres and weight in hectograms, a byte with
  page 1's length, page 1 and page 2. The game prints them metric unless its UNITS option (wOptions2 CFD1 bit 2) says
  imperial (51:4144 converts). The list (10:48DF) is the 253 species at 10:4915 in that order, numbered by their place
  (10:4847); seen / caught stay a bit per species id. The picture: GetMonFrontpic (0B:6F54) reads {bank, address} at
  17:4000 + 6 per species (the bank itself, no FixPicBank), Crystal's LZ, the size from BaseData; colours from 02:4C84 by
  species (Crystal's table where the species kept Crystal's id). The bag's text: 11:4AD0 (items, 11:4AF9) and the TM
  pocket's move text (0B:49EB, 0B:5704).
- **Its text engine** (`Gen2PackedText`; 00:3266 runs it): segments - a plain string to its 0x50 (PlaceString 00:2FC5,
  control characters 0x44-0x5F by 00:301C's table, some a bank-0 word: "Poké", "Trainer"), a reference (0x04-0x43 + a
  byte: the address less 0x3C00, then the bank, bit 7 = the text ends after it), 03 + a Huffman stream (35:4E14: bits
  most significant first down the tree at 35:4E9A, two bytes a node, leaves from 0x70; 0x78-0x7B are 0x58-0x5B,
  0xBC-0xCF the control characters 0x44-0x57, 0x7D + 4 bits from 35:4F74, 0x7C + 6 bits through the ranges at 35:4F84;
  a 0x50 leaf ends the stream), 01 + code (32C5 jumps into it: only the UNITS choice is used in the dex, `ld a,
  [wOptions2] / and 4 / ld hl, metric / ret z / ld hl, imperial / ret`); the text ends at a 0x50 where a segment starts
  or at a 0x57 (done: the caller reads on past it). Checked headless: the Pokédex flag (D84C bit 0) and every seen /
  caught bit poked on the prism save, START > Pokédex, then LARVITAR, FROSLASS (a UNITS text), PHANCERO, VARANEOUS,
  RAIWATO, FAMBACO and LIBABEEL: both page halves, HT / WT and the picture pixel for pixel (`PrismDexTest`'s CRCs);
  every page and item description decodes.
- **Not done**: GUIDE, the POKéMON switch, the CARD, STEADY FF music, abilities (Prism has them), the player's head on
  the map; the dex follows the UNITS option's default (metric) rather than the save's choice.

**The European Emeralds** (Spanish / German / French / Italian, BPES / BPED /
BPEF / BPEI, rev 0; `NATIVE_EMERALD_ES` / `_DE` / `_FR` / `_IT`) are English's
game: every RAM address the app reads is English's, and English's save loads in
each with the same party bytes, money and position (`emerald_es` / `_de` / `_fr`
/ `_it`: headless boots of that save, `EmeraldLanguagesTest`). German / Italian's
battle code sits 4 bytes later. Their ROM data moved (localized text has other
lengths) but kept English's layouts; each table was found as the word English's
code loads it from, read at the same place in the language's code (icons, dex,
trainers, learnsets, wild encounters). What's theirs:
- **Names in the game's language** (species, moves, items, natures, map
  sections; item descriptions are read from the ROM at runtime, see "Item
  descriptions" below): `scripts/gen_emerald_lang_tables.py` reads them from
  each ROM into `EmeraldText<Lang>Gen.kt` (its `en` mode decodes English's
  tables the same way and matches the app's). `NativeConfig.language` →
  `romLanguage` → `localEmerald` switches the lookups; `gameCase` leaves them
  alone. Types stay English's (the type colours are keyed by name). Each game
  redrew its POKéBLOCK glyphs for its own word (RIEGEL, CUBO, BLOC, Italian's
  MELLE / MELLA at 0x5E-0x63), read off the fonts. Hand-written GUIDE entries
  still tag areas by English name (`englishMapSecName`).
- **The dex page** as each game words it, from headless screenshots of
  TORCHIC's: German / French print the category alone, Spanish / Italian put
  POKéMON first (`categoryPrefix`), all four in metres / kilograms with a
  decimal comma (`metric`). `pokedexMatchesRom` checks each game's own word for
  BULBASAUR's category (`probeCategory`: SEMILLA / SAMEN / GRAINE / SEME), the
  guide probe each game's ROXANNE (PETRA / FELIZIA / ROXANNE / PETRA).
- **Party art**: the slot tiles (the HP label: PS / KP / PV, and the level
  glyph), status icons and FONT_SMALL (+ its widths) are localized, so they're
  fingerprinted per language (`EM_<LANG>_*`, `gen_rom_art_sigs.py`) and land in
  `partyem_<lang>/`; the backdrop and Poke Ball are English's, pixel for pixel.
- **No TRAINER CARD** yet: their cards are localized art, not matched.

**Japanese Emerald** (BPEJ, rev 0, `NATIVE_EMERALD_JA`) is its own build, but the
same game underneath: English's save loads in it with the same party bytes,
money and position, and a scripted wild battle reads with English's
BattlePokemon / gMain layouts (`emerald_ja`, `emerald_ja_battle`). What moved:
- **Every RAM global and the battle code** (-0x3F0): found through English's
  literal pools, word for word; the action / move / bag / party handlers were
  checked in that battle, the party menu at 0x0203CB94 (the POKéMON switch),
  the region map watch's three pointers likewise.
- **Shorter ROM records**: dex entries are 0x1C bytes (categoryName[6], height
  +6, weight +8, text +0x0C - `PokedexTables.entryCategoryLen` / `entryHeightOff`
  / `entryDescOff`), ability names 8, trainers 0x20 (trainerName[6], partySize
  +0x18, party +0x1C - `GuideTables.trainer*`), items 40 (name[10], text +16);
  species / move names 6 / 8 bytes. gItems and the nature names were found by
  content (its code doesn't match English's there).
- **Kana**: hiragana / katakana where the Western letters are (charmap.txt's
  Japanese half). `gen_emerald_lang_tables.py ja` writes its names;
  `Gen3Text` switches to its Japanese table while `romLanguage == 'J'` (dex
  text, abilities, trainer names), a line break reading as a full-width space.
  The dex page: "ひよこポケモン", "0.4m", "2.5kg" (`categorySeparator`,
  `decimalPoint`, `unitSpace`), as the game prints TORCHIC's.
- **Party slot**: the app's palette slot, which draws kana with the app's
  Japanese font - its own FONT_SMALL isn't the Western layout the slot art
  draws names with. No TRAINER CARD.

**Emerald Legacy v1.1.4** (BPEE, 16 MB, sha1 `cbd71af6…`, `NATIVE_EMERALD_LEGACY`) keeps retail's header but is a
rebuild: its source (cRz-Shadows/Pokemon_Emerald_Legacy, tag `V1.1.4`) cloned into `$DECOMPS/pokelegacy` and built
with agbcc (`make` in the decomp build image, after `/opt/agbcc/install.sh`) is the release byte for byte, so every
address in the app is a symbol of that ELF, and struct offsets / constants come from agbcc compiling `offsetof` against
its headers. It runs as `GameKind.EMERALD` (retail's look, art, map and menus: all 35 retail art blobs are in it,
byte for byte) under its own text key `LEGACY_TEXT` (`emeraldLegacy`), like Kaizo. What differs from retail:
- **RAM**: the battle globals kept retail's EWRAM (cursors, gEnemyParty, gBattleStruct); gMain, the save-block
  pointers, gObjectEvents, gMapHeader, gBagPockets, gPartyMenu and the battle input handlers moved. Every retail-keyed
  place checks `emeraldLegacy` first (the POKéMON switch, RegionMapWatch's pointers, field items), or it would read
  retail's addresses under the same BPEE header.
- **SaveBlock1** grew: a 120-slot ITEMS pocket (0x168 bytes more), 960 trainer flags (`MAX_TRAINERS_COUNT`: the
  system flags start at 0x8C0, not 0x860) and one more var. Flags +0x13D8, vars +0x1510, game stats +0x1714, dex seen
  copies +0xAF0 / +0x3B34, contest winners +0x3008; SaveBlock2's frontier is 0x14 longer (its Pyramid bag holds 13).
  The bag goes through gBagPockets, so it needs nothing; the dex, guide and card tables carry the offsets. The PC
  BOXES editor refuses it (`SaveFileEdits.formatFor`): it would edit the bag at retail's offsets.
- **Species**: three Deoxys forms at 412-414, SPECIES_EGG 415 - an egg is flagged (`NativeConfig.eggSpecies`) and
  `isVanillaEgg` is off for it; the forms take DEOXYS's types. ~130 moves rebalanced (a few change type), two new
  effects: `gen_emerald_lang_tables.py legacy` writes its names, move types / powers and the move advice's
  `MoveStats`. Its Hoenn dex is 210 (eight added after DEOXYS).
- **Guide**: its own (`GuideEmeraldLegacy.kt`): WALLACE leads SOOTOPOLIS until the HALL OF FAME, STEVEN is champion,
  BRAWLY's team follows the badges you have; WHERE IS and HERE's people / items come from its tree
  (`gen_guide_areas.py legacy`). Its trainers are one `struct TrainerMon` (`GuideTables.trainerMon`). About 40 maps keep
  a second set of wild Pokémon in the header after their first, picked by a var once the post-game event in MOSSDEEP
  CITY sets it (`GuideTables.wildSetVars`, `wildSetOf`).
- **TRAINER CARD**: `CardStyle.LEGACY` - retail's card plus a sixth palette (`LG_CARD_PAL5`, its black card): catching
  MEW is a fifth star. Matched pixel for pixel against its own card, plain and with every star poked in
  (`emerald_legacy_stars`).
- **WIDE**: the EX family (ghoulslash's overworld expansion: ObjectEvent.spriteId +0x23, a u16 template graphicsId at +2
  with the kind at +1, 300 graphics records), every map and battle frame exact (`verify_wide.py`).

**The other-language FireRed / LeafGreen / Ruby / Sapphire** (and English Ruby /
Sapphire rev 0) aren't hand-ported: `scripts/port_retail.py <roms dir>` does what
the Emerald ones needed, for every ROM in the dir, and `scripts/verify_ports.py`
checks the result headlessly. What the port script does per ROM:
1. picks the English ROM (same dir) whose code is most alike;
2. maps every address of its config - RAM and ROM tables through the literal pools
   of the code that loads them (the code before each use of the word in English,
   found in the language's code: the word there), battle handlers by their code
   bytes; fallbacks for what those miss: the handlers' code with BL targets blanked,
   near where the other handlers moved; language-neutral tables (species ->
   national, the icon tables) by their bytes / what they point at; ability names by
   their shape; natures by a pointer table starting with that language's HARDY;
3. detects the layouts Japanese shrank from known values (BULBASAUR's 7 / 69 for the
   dex entries, item ids 1, 2, 3... for gItems, 40 trainers in a row for gTrainers),
   and `struct Main`'s inBattle offset (a literal too: Japanese Ruby / Sapphire's is
   0x439, English's 0x43D);
4. reads the names (`GameText<Code>Gen.kt`), the probes (the dex's BULBASAUR
   category, the gym leader's name) and the FireReds' party art offsets, and writes
   `RetailPortsGen.kt`: one config per game code + revision (`RETAIL_PORTS`, which
   `TelemetrySampler.otherRetailConfig` consults first), titles by SHA1, the name sets.
   `build/ports/ports.json` records how each address was found.

`verify_ports.py` boots every ported ROM and its English one (pokedaisy-capture,
`mgba_dump`) with that game's English save - the other languages load it as is -
dumps it on the field and in a scripted wild battle (stepping through FIGHT / BAG /
POKéMON and reading gBattlerControllerFuncs at each), then `PortsVerifyTest` compares
each with English: party, bag, money, place, the dex (every national number's species,
height and weight), the guide tables and the gym leader's party, the battlers, the
battle handlers, and that every name resolves. It writes `build/ports/report.md` and
`build/ports/fields.png` (every ROM's field, at a glance). All 34 pass. `PortedRomsTest`
keeps four of those dumps (`port_*`, against `port_en_*`) as fixtures. The party art the
European FireReds redrew (HP label, status icons, font) is fingerprinted from the ports
(`FR_<LANG>_*`, `gen_rom_art_sigs.py`) into `partyfr_<lang>/`; European Ruby / Sapphire
borrow that language's Emerald art, as English Ruby / Sapphire borrow English's.
Japanese FireRed / LeafGreen can't load the English saves ("the saved data was lost"),
so they boot with Japanese ones (`host_roms.conf`'s `firered_ja` / `leafgreen_ja`) and are
checked absolutely instead (no English run to compare with: real Pokémon, real items,
money in range, a named place - plus the ROM-only checks); their money / encryption key
offsets (English's, `0x290` / `0xF20`) matched the game's own trainer card (100171円 /
83420円), and `PortedRomsTest` pins Japanese FireRed's (`port_bprj1`). Japanese Emerald
was rechecked the same way with a Japanese save (`emerald_ja_own`: 284669円, 101 caught,
as its card shows). The Pokémon Box / debug / pirate dumps are skipped.

**LeafGreen / Ruby / Sapphire were checked against the games themselves**
(2026-09-29): each ROM booted headlessly with the user's save
(`capture_fixture_headless.sh <key> --script native-capture/boot/leafgreen.txt`
or `ruby_sapphire.txt`), the game's own party menu, every bag pocket and the
POKéDEX screenshotted, and the app's decode of the same RAM compared
(`LeafGreenDecodeTest`, `RubySapphireDecodeTest`, both revisions each):

| Save                       | Party (game screen = app)                                                            | Bag                                                                     | POKéDEX seen / owned      |

| Ruby (FEDE, Slateport)     | RAYQUAZA 100, GROUDON 56, ZAPDOS 68, BLAZIKEN 100, CHARIZARD 100, ARTICUNO 68        | POTION … REVIVE · ULTRA ×17, DIVE ×3, NET ×2 · ITEMFINDER, MACH BIKE, … | 133 / 29                  |
| Sapphire (AHS, Oldale)     | WAILORD 40, RAYQUAZA, KYOGRE, MEW, CHARIZARD, MEWTWO (100)                           | Items empty · ULTRA BALL ×11 · TM20 + HMs · MACH BIKE, CONTEST PASS, …  | 199 / 159                 |

The Ruby save's newer slot is internally inconsistent, so the game itself
says "The save file is corrupt" and loads the older slot — the fixtures hold
that one. Ruby's TM case lists TM13 before the HMs in game; the app keeps the
save's slot order (as it does for Emerald).

### POKéDEX (DEX tab)

A **DEX** tab (between PARTY and MAP) lists every entry of the regional or
National Dex with the save's seen / caught marks, filters (ALL / CAUGHT /
SEEN ONLY / NOT SEEN), and a full entry page: front sprite, category, types,
height / weight in the game's own rounding, footprint, the dex text, base
stats, abilities (+ hidden where the game has them), egg groups, gender, catch rate. The
flags come from the save in RAM (checked the way each game's own
`GetSetPokedexFlag` does, anti-cheat copies included); everything else is read
from the running ROM (`companion/data/Pokedex.kt`, `ui/PokedexScreen.kt`). Only
games with a `PokedexTables` config get the tab:

| ROM                             | Dexes                                                       | Where the flags are                              | Checked against the game's own POKéDEX                                         |

Emerald Rogue and R.O.W.E. have none: Rogue's dex (it has one: seen 2 /
caught 1 in the user's save) isn't a seen / caught bit array anywhere in RAM,
and R.O.W.E.'s party isn't decoded yet.

**How the hacks' dex data was found** (no source for any of them): the
tables in each ROM by content — BULBASAUR's base stats and SEED entry,
species 1's `{ptr, size, tag}` pic records, a 1, 2, 3 ... species -> dex run,
STENCH then DRIZZLE — keeping the copy the code references when a stale one is
left behind, then decoded and rendered. Hacks that number their dex their own
way (Amethyst, Celia, Seaglass, TMT2) were read off the game's own list in RAM
(EWRAM `{label, flags << 16 | species}` items on the FireRed engine,
`{u16 dexNum, seen:1, owned:1}` on the expansion one) and the matching table
found in the ROM. The flags came from headless captures of the user's saves
(the starter / rival bits), then each game's own POKéDEX confirmed them: a
save without a POKéDEX got FLAG_SYS_POKEDEX_GET (FireRed engine: poked into
SaveBlock1's flags; expansion: the game's own `FlagSet` called with
`mgba_dump`'s `call`), and `poke8p PTR OFF VAL` (a save-block-relative poke —
Emerald moves its save blocks on every load) set or cleared bits while
watching the counts. A regional dex whose order wasn't obvious (Heart and
Soul's Johto, a u32 list) was read by marking every species seen and dumping
the full list the game builds.

pokeemerald-expansion hacks (Heart and Soul, Lazarus, Seaglass, TMT2) keep the
whole dex page in each `gSpeciesInfo` entry (`SpeciesInfoDex`: category,
natDexNum, height/weight, description, front pic — smol-compressed on Heart
and Soul — palette, footprint), three u16 abilities (the third hidden) and
inline 17-byte ability names 0x1C apart; their flags are SaveBlock1
`dexSeen` / `dexCaught`. Radical Red, Amethyst and Gaia use CFRU's type ids
(Fairy = 23) and Odyssey turned vanilla's `???` (9) into Fairy, so their type
names follow; Seaglass uses the standard expansion ids.

Unbound is the odd one: CFRU keeps its flags at SaveBlock1+0x310 (seen) and
+0x38D (owned), 1000 bits each with no anti-cheat copies — found in a headless
capture and confirmed by poking a bit and watching the game's counts rise —
and the Borrius order (498 species ids at `0x09A3F398`) was read off the
game's own list in RAM. The owned array starting at an odd address exposed a
JNI bug (fixed): `pk_read_range` did unaligned `busRead32`s, which rotate like
the CPU's `LDR`, so the device showed GIBLE's bit as GALLADE's. Retail configs
are gated by `pokedexMatchesRom` (entry 1 must be SEED, 7 dm, 69 hg), since an
unknown hack of the same size falls through to them. The hacks' configs are
SHA1-pinned like the rest of their support. Tests: `HackPokedexTest` (each
`<game>_dex` fixture's flags vs what the game showed, and every listed entry
decoding from the user's ROM) and Paparazzi shots of each hack's list / entry.

### Item descriptions (ITEMS tab)

The games' item descriptions aren't bundled (they're the games' own prose; item
names still are): `itemDescription(id)` reads them from the player's ROM through
`RomItemText` (`companion/data/RomItemText.kt`), the way the dex reads its
flavour text, and caches each per ROM. Where a game keeps them is
`NativeConfig.itemDescs`, an `ItemDescTable` (base, stride, the description
pointer's offset, optionally an id range and a second table):

- vanilla `struct Item` (44 bytes, description at +0x14; `vanillaItems`):
  retail FireRed / LeafGreen / Emerald / Ruby / Sapphire (R/S capped at their
  349 items), the binary hacks (Glazed in place; Unbound, Radical Red, Amethyst
  and Celia repointed - the word FireRed 1.0's literal pools load gItems from,
  Celia's found by shape), Gaia / Odyssey at retail's address;
- Japanese releases: 40-byte records, description at +0x10 (`japaneseItems`);
- expansion hacks (`gItemsInfo`): the generators' name anchor with the
  description pointer 8 bytes before it (HnS / SoulGold 0x2C, Lazarus /
  Imperium 0x50, Seaglass / TMT2 0x54); Emerald Rogue (gItems 0x28 + its own
  gRogueItems from 827), Quetzal (0x1C, +0xC), R.O.W.E. (0x38, +0x1C), Super Mariomon
  (0x28 records, description at +0x14, no itemId; 824 items in v1.5, 821 before).

`scripts/port_retail.py` writes each port's `itemDescs` (its detected item
table); the other generators print theirs. A config whose vanilla table
doesn't check out (`matchesRom`) falls back to a scan by shape
(`RomItemText.findVanillaItems`: item ids 1, 2, 3... in consecutive records),
once per ROM. Yellow keeps our own hand-written
text (Gen 1 items have none); Crystal's and Crystal Clear's are read from the cart (`Gen2Dex.itemDescription`). Text decodes with `Gen3Text` (Japanese for
`romLanguage` 'J', each language's POKéBLOCK glyphs, placeholders dropped),
line breaks collapsed to spaces.

Checked against the bundled tables they replaced, every id, every ROM on the
dev machine (2026-10-09): identical for Emerald, the five other-language
Emeralds, all 31 other-language FireRed / LeafGreen / Ruby / Sapphire ports, Heart
and Soul, Lazarus, SoulGold, Rogue, Seaglass, Glazed, Imperium, Quetzal and
R.O.W.E. The rest changed for the better: FireRed / LeafGreen TMs show
the move's text the game shows (the decomp's `description_english` for TMs is
unused); Ruby / Sapphire their own wording (they borrowed Emerald's); Unbound,
Gaia, Odyssey and Amethyst their own (they borrowed vanilla FireRed's); Radical
Red's item 255 is the slot the game reads (the old table keyed a stale
`.itemId`); SoulGold v1.2's TM75 needs no special case; Celia and TMT2 have
descriptions now. `RomItemTextTest` pins a few per game (skipped without the ROM).

### GUIDE tab

Hint-first pages per game (title, tap = hint, tap = answer): TIPS / WHERE IS /
STUCK? where written by hand, plus HERE (the current area's wild Pokémon,
people and items), NEXT BOSS and EVOLUTIONS read live from ROM + save. Every
fact comes from the game's own data, in our own words; all but FireRed are
`verified = false` until checked in play.

Generated WHERE IS (`generatedWhereIs`): every HM, key item and gift Pokémon
someone hands out, with its area as the hint. The hacks without source get their
area data from `scripts/gen_guide_areas_rom.py`, which walks a FireRed-engine
ROM's map headers and event scripts (command sizes from pokefirered's
`event.inc`) for item balls, hidden items, `giveitem`/`finditem`/`additem`,
`givemon`/`giveegg` and badge-setting `trainerbattle`s (`--bosses`); checked
against the decomp-generated FireRed data with `--compare` (items and hidden
items exact). Unbound XORs its map-group pointers (`--groups 08b70498
--groups-xor 00b749de`); a script handing out more than 5 different things
(Radical Red's shop / menu scripts) is dropped as noise. An object using the item-ball sprite counts its
gift as an item lying there (Odyssey's balls run `giveitem`); empty map slots
are skipped, not the end of a group (Amethyst, which needs `--groups 083526a8`: vanilla's gMapGroups, missed by the shape scan); `gItems` is found by shape when
item names were changed (Celia). Hack tables (`gMapGroups`, `gWildMonHeaders`,
`gLevelUpLearnsets`, `gTrainers`) were found from the literal pools of
FireRed's own code that uses them (`--groups` when the shape scan misses).
Amethyst's trainer loader picks one of four `gTrainers` (`GuideTables.altTrainers`,
an id or'd with `(k + 1) << 16`); CFRU's 3-byte learnsets (`learnsetCfru`) give
Unbound / Radical Red / Amethyst teams without custom moves their moves. Unbound's
difficulty teams were read by running its own leader-picking routine headlessly
(`mgba_dump call`) for every gym x difficulty. Tests: `*GuideTest`, Paparazzi
`*Guide*` shots.

### How a new ROM gets supported

When there's no source (most of the ROM hacks above), addresses are found by
forcing a live memory dump off the device and brute-force-scanning it, not by
guessing:

1. `PokeDaisyActivity`'s `EXTRA_DUMP_FIXTURE`/`EXTRA_DUMP_FIXTURE_FORCE` intent
   extras dump the full EWRAM (256 KB) + IWRAM (32 KB) to a device file —
   `scripts/capture_fixture.sh <key>` drives this (live session if the app's
   already running via `onNewIntent`, cold relaunch otherwise) and pulls the
   result into `app/src/test/resources/fixtures/<key>/{ewram,iwram}.bin`.
2. `gPlayerParty` is found by scanning every 4-byte-aligned offset for a valid
   Gen3 `struct Pokemon` (`PID^OTID` key, `PID%24` substruct order, 16-bit
   checksum over the 12 decrypted words) — a checksum match is ~1/65536 odds,
   so it's a strong signal, **but not proof**: verify any hit against another
   independently-captured session before trusting it (a single capture can't
   tell a real global from a lucky transient-memory coincidence). Don't stop
   at two, either, and don't let a _structurally_ plausible match (e.g. an
   IWRAM pointer landing at exactly vanilla's `SaveBlock1+0x238` playerParty
   offset) substitute for it: Lazarus's first false lead was caught by a 2nd
   capture, but Emerald Rogue's false lead survived two back-to-back captures
   _and_ had a matching pointer, and only broke on a 3rd capture taken later
   after more real play time — turned out to be a relocatable scratch buffer
   that happened to coincidentally hold valid data, twice in a row, not a
   stable global. Cross-session address stability, checked against as many
   independent captures as it takes, is the only signal that actually proves
   it — everything else is corroborating at best. (Both incidents are
   preserved in `NATIVE_LAZARUS`/`NATIVE_EMERALD_ROGUE`'s comments.)
3. Other fields (bag pockets, save-block pointers, encryption key) are found
   the same way — searching memory for a pointer that resolves to an
   already-confirmed address, or for a value that matches an
   already-confirmed encryption key — rather than assuming vanilla's struct
   offsets hold (they often don't, even when the checksum/party layout is
   otherwise vanilla-compatible).
4. ROM-embedded data (icon graphics tables, item/species name tables) is a
   _different_ hunt — it's static ROM content, not RAM. Name tables are the
   tractable end of this: they're plain Gen 3-encoded text, findable by
   anchoring on 1-2 known names at known indices (e.g. "Bulbasaur"@1,
   "Ivysaur"@2) and walking the fixed-stride array from there — see
   the private ROM-hack project's `tools/telemetry-viewer/scripts/gen_unbound_data.py`'s
   `find_fixed_name_table`/`walk_name_table`/`gen_items`, reused as-is for
   Amethyst's species/item tables (`SpeciesNamesAmethyst.kt`/
   `ItemNamesAmethyst.kt`). Don't assume one anchor covers the whole range,
   though — Amethyst's species table turned out to be split: the vanilla
   1-251 block was findable from "Bulbasaur", but that walk silently ran into
   an _unrelated_ adjacent table (move names, which also happen to satisfy
   the Gen 3 text charset) past index 251, while the real, complete table
   (covering 1-1267, including the new species) lived at a totally different
   ROM address — only found by anchoring on a species confirmed from a live
   read instead ("Tepig" at the user's actual in-game species id). Icon
   graphics tables are the hard end — no text anchor to search for, so it
   needs either real source, a still-byte-identical helper function whose
   literal pool holds the relocated address (Gaia's icon tables were found
   this way), or a structural pattern search with something to validate a
   candidate against (Lazarus's and Emerald Rogue's icon table searches both
   came up empty for lack of either). The literal-pool technique isn't
   limited to whatever revision you happen to have addresses for already —
   Amethyst's `GetItemIconGfxPtr` needed the _rev 0_ address specifically
   (rev 1's didn't decode to anything real when tried directly), which
   wasn't on file, so it was obtained by building the pinned pokefirered
   commit **completely unpatched** in a pokefirered build
   Docker image (stash/move aside any patch files first) and reading
   `nm`'s symbol table — confirmed byte-identical to real retail rev 0 via
   sha1 first, so the address is exact, not guessed. However a candidate
   address is obtained, decode something through it end-to-end and look at
   the result (render tiles+palette to a PNG) rather than trusting that
   "looks like a valid ROM pointer" alone — Amethyst's mon/item icons were
   confirmed by actually seeing a recognizable Tepig and Potion bottle.
5. Once addresses are confirmed, add a fixture (step 1) + a
   `<Game>DecodeTest.kt` under `app/src/test/kotlin/.../companion/data/`
   asserting the known real values from that capture — this is what keeps a
   future refactor from silently re-breaking a hard-won address. `forkEvery = 1`
   in `build.gradle.kts` restarts the test JVM per class, needed because the
   bag-read throttle in `NativeReader.kt` is file-level mutable state shared
   process-wide.

**pokeemerald-expansion hacks** (a "PRET x RHH" boot splash) can be done with
no device at all: `scripts/capture_fixture_headless.sh <key> --script
native-capture/boot/rhh_splash.txt`, plus extra hand-run captures with a varied
first `wait` to prove each address stays put. Then add a `GAMES` entry to
`scripts/gen_expansion_tables.py` for the ROM-side tables (species names,
types and gender ratios, items, moves, the type chart, mapsec names). Things
that bit Heart and Soul:

- A checksum scan that filters on "plausible species" finds nothing when
  BoxPokemon packs `species:11|teraType:5`. Mask before filtering, or search
  for the nickname text instead.
- Building the hack's source tag isn't the same as the release. Heart and
  Soul's from-source addresses were 4 bytes off.
- `struct BattlePokemon` and the SaveBlock1 layout change between expansion
  versions (`NativeConfig.battleMonLayout` / `saveBlock1PosOff`). A battle
  capture is the only way to check them. Wild encounters depend on the RTC,
  so pace in grass and dump every step.
- Item icon tiles may be smol-compressed (header low nibble 1-6), not LZ77.
  `Smol.kt` handles both.

## Launch from a frontend (Cocoon, iiSU, ES-DE, ...)

Frontends can open a game in PokeDaisy directly, with no library screen in
between. Leaving the game (hold BACK, or the exit hotkey) returns to the frontend.
Add PokeDaisy as a custom / standalone emulator for GBA:

| Field    | Value                                                                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Package  | `com.pokedaisy.app`                                                                              |
| Activity | `com.pokedaisy.app.LaunchActivity`                                                               |
| Action   | `android.intent.action.VIEW`                                                                      |
| Data     | the ROM (a `content://` link or a `file://` path - whatever the frontend's ROM placeholder gives) |

Instead of the data, the ROM can also come as a string extra `rom` (or `ROM`,
`path`, `file`, `uri`) holding a path or a URI. A frontend that only takes the app
(its launcher intent) plus the ROM works too: the library forwards it to
`LaunchActivity`.

What `LaunchActivity` does with the ROM:

- **A real path we can read** (`file://`, or a `content://` link from the system's
  storage provider, which is what folder grants give): the game runs from there,
  no copy. On Android 11+ that needs **All files access** (Settings > Folders >
  Change folder asks for it; a launch that can't read the path opens that
  permission page, and a `content://` link falls back to the copy below).
- **Anything else** (another app's provider): copied into the library once, under
  its own name, and reused on later launches while its bytes are unchanged.
- Saves are found by the ROM's name in the saves folder, as always - point
  Settings > Folders at the frontend's / RetroArch's saves to share them.
- No "add anyway?" prompt: an unsupported ROM plays with the companion's "not
  supported" notice.
- Launching a different game while one is open switches to it (the open one is
  suspended first, as on exit); the same game just comes back.

Step-by-step setup: [iiSU](iisu/README.md), [ES-DE](es-de/README.md). Cocoon only
lists emulators from its own platform files, so PokeDaisy has to be added there by
its developer.

To try it without a frontend:

```bash
adb shell am start -n com.pokedaisy.app/.LaunchActivity \
  -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "file:///storage/emulated/0/ROMs/gba/firered.gba"
adb shell am start -n com.pokedaisy.app/.LaunchActivity \
  --es rom /storage/emulated/0/ROMs/gba/firered.gba
```

## Hotkeys

Read from `files/hotkeys.properties` (written with defaults on first run), and
rebindable in Settings > HOTKEYS. Values are Android key names, comma-separated.

| Action                      | Default buttons                          |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `save_state` (current slot) | `SELECT`+`R1`, `BUTTON_Y`, keyboard `F1` |
| `load_state` (current slot) | `SELECT`+`L1`, `BUTTON_X`, keyboard `F2` |
| `undo_save` / `undo_load`   | keyboard `F3` / `F4`                     |
| `slot_next`                 | keyboard `]`                             |
| `slot_prev`                 | `BUTTON_THUMBL` (left-stick click), `[`  |
| `ff_hold`                   | `BUTTON_R2`, keyboard `SPACE`            |
| `ff_toggle`                 | keyboard `TAB`                           |
| `speed_cycle`               | `BUTTON_L2`, keyboard `=`                |
| `slowmo_hold`               | keyboard `-`                             |
| `zoom` (WIDE's zoom steps)  | `BUTTON_THUMBR` (right-stick click), `C` |
| `exit_game`                 | `SELECT`+`START`, keyboard `ESC`         |

Single-button defaults use only buttons the GBA itself doesn't need; the SELECT
chords are the exception. Hotkey buttons are not forwarded to the game.

The **right and left analog triggers** are also wired directly (many handhelds,
maybe the Thor, report L2/R2 as axes not buttons): right trigger = hold
fast-forward, left trigger = hold slow-mo. If a physical button doesn't trigger
its hotkey, press it once and check `adb logcat -s pokedaisy` for an
`unmapped key <code> (NAME)` line, then put `NAME` in `hotkeys.properties`.

## Cheats

GameShark / Action Replay (v1-v3) / CodeBreaker / VBA codes on mGBA's own cheat engine,
GBA only. Where they live: top-screen Settings > CHEATS (also a game's library menu > CHEATS)
adds them - typed (ADD CODE: NAME, CODE, TYPE AUTO / GAMESHARK / ACTION REPLAY / CODEBREAKER)
or imported (IMPORT FILE: RetroArch's libretro `.cht` or mGBA's `.cheats`) - and turns them on
and off; the companion's SETTINGS > CHEATS only toggles (no keyboard there). Typed codes start
ON, imported ones OFF. `Prefs.cheatsEnabled` is the master switch (off by default).

- **Storage**: `filesDir/cheats/<ROM CRC32>.cheats`, mGBA's `.cheats` format, enabled flags
  included, each cheat standing alone (`!reset`, then `!disabled` / its directive, `# NAME`,
  code lines). Keyed by CRC so a renamed or zipped ROM keeps them. Not a save: never in the
  saves folder, never backed up. Nothing is bundled (codes are community content).
- **Parsing** (`cheats/Cheats.kt`): the file formats are read in Kotlin - mGBA's parsers stop at
  a Windows line ending and drop lines they can't read without a word. Every code line still
  goes through mGBA's own code parser (`MgbaCore.pkCheatsCheck`, a scratch cheat device, no core
  needed) before it's kept; a code with a line mGBA can't read is refused with that line named,
  and IMPORT FILE reports how many it left out. The check also returns the directive mGBA settled
  on (`GSAv1`, `PARv3`...), stored with the cheat so an encrypted code loads the same way every time.
- **Loading** (`pk_cheats.c`): `EmulatorEngine` hands the core the *enabled* cheats as one
  `.cheats` text (`pkCheatsApply`) after the save backup and the resume, before the first frame,
  and again whenever a toggle changes it. Taking them out runs a disabled refresh and removes
  each set, so hooks and ROM patches are undone - with no cheat on the ROM is the file again.
- **Debuggers stay off**: GBA cheats run at frame end, or from a ROM hook (a BKPT that lands
  on the cheat device's CPU component, outside mGBA's `USE_DEBUGGERS` code). Checked headless with
  the app's own mGBA flags (`native-capture/README.md`, "Cheats").
- **The ROM still identifies the game**: a hook or ROM-patch code changes the ROM mGBA runs from,
  which the Poller hashes over the bus (hack SHA1s) and RetroAchievements hashes. `pk_cheats.c`
  keeps the original bytes under every patch: `pkReadBytes` puts them back into its reads, and
  `raLoadGame` swaps them in around the hash.
- **RetroAchievements**: while any cheat is loaded, `rc_client_idle` runs instead of
  `rc_client_do_frame` (nothing is checked or unlocked), a CHEATS ON / CHEATS OFF notice pops up
  for a game with a set, and the ACHIEVEMENTS tab shows PAUSED: CHEATS ON.
- **Savestates** don't carry cheats (`SAVESTATE_CHEATS` isn't in the flags); a state made with a
  cheat on does carry the memory it wrote, like any emulator.

## PC BOXES and TRADE (save files)

A game's library menu > PC BOXES (`SaveEditorActivity`, `companion/ui/PcBoxesScreen.kt`) reads the
save file with the game closed, rearranges the PC, edits values and trades with another game's save. Event flags
come next, on the same reader and writer.

**It's off by default** (`FeatureFlags.saveEditor`) until it has been tried on real saves: the library menu has no
PC BOXES row and `SaveEditorActivity` closes itself. Turn it on for a build with `./gradlew assembleDebug
-Ppokedaisy.saveEditor=true` (or `pokedaisy.saveEditor=true` in local.properties: `BuildConfig.FEATURE_SAVE_EDITOR`),
or on a device with any build already installed:

```sh
adb shell mkdir -p /sdcard/Android/data/com.pokedaisy.app/files/features
adb shell touch /sdcard/Android/data/com.pokedaisy.app/files/features/save_editor   # rm it to turn it off
```

When it ships, drop the flag and put its README lines back (PC boxes, TRADE, editing).

- **Reading** (`companion/data/save/Gen3SaveFile.kt`): the Gen 3 flash layout as pret's `save.c`
  has it. Two 14-sector slots (0x0000, 0xE000); each 4 KB sector is 0xF80 bytes of data, then its
  id, checksum (the u32 words of its chunk summed, both halves folded), signature `0x08012025` and
  the save counter. Ids rotate inside a slot. The game loads the slot whose 14 sectors are all
  valid with the newer counter (`GetSaveValidStatus`, including its 0xFFFFFFFF -> 0 wrap), and so
  does the reader. Checksums cover each chunk's real size (`Gen3SaveFormat`: SaveBlock2 0x890 R/S,
  0xF24 FR/LG, 0xF2C E; SaveBlock1 0x3AC0 / 0x3D68 / 0x3D88; PokemonStorage 0x83D0), not the
  whole sector.
- **Writing** is a save as the game would make it: the edit goes into the *other* slot with the
  counter + 1 and the rotation + 1, each sector zeroed and filled like `HandleWriteSector`. The
  slot the game loaded stays as it was, so it's the game's own fallback if the new slot were
  bad. `withBlocks` reads its own output back before handing it out (`verifyWritten`): the new
  slot wins, the old one still loads, the blocks are exactly the edit, and no byte outside the
  new slot changed (Hall of Fame, Trainer Hill, recorded battle, mGBA's RTC footer).
- **The file** (`SaveFileEdits`): the save must still be what was read, a `SaveBackups` copy of
  it must exist, the edit goes to a synced temp file moved over the save, and it's read back
  (the backup goes back if it differs). Then `boot_fresh` (like LOAD SAVE): a resume state
  holds the old save and would write it back. A game left open behind the library is safe: its
  engine stopped on pause and reloads the file on start (`pkStateMatchesSave`). A **manual**
  savestate made before the edit still carries the old save, as with any outside change.
- **Which saves**: `Gen3SaveFormat.forGameCode` (AXV / AXP / BPE / BPR / BPG, not Japanese:
  shorter names change the structs) on ROMs up to 16 MB. `Gen3SaveData.mismatch()` then refuses a
  save that doesn't decode as that layout (party count, party checksums and species, the PC's
  records), which catches CFRU's plaintext boxes and expansion hacks that kept a vanilla game
  code. Hacks get their own layouts later, per `NativeConfig`.
- **Box records** (`Gen3BoxMon`): the 80-byte BoxPokemon decrypted (personality ^ OT id) and
  reordered (personality % 24); `encode()` gives back the game's bytes. A record whose checksum
  fails is a Bad Egg in the game and is never moved or re-encoded. Step one only moves records
  byte for byte, between PC slots: the party (100-byte records with stats) is shown, not moved or traded.
- **Tests**: `Gen3SaveFileTest` / `SaveFileEditsTest` build saves from scratch with their own
  writer (`SyntheticSave`: no real save can be in this public repo). Before trusting a change
  to the writer with real saves, boot an edited save headlessly (`mgba_dump`) and check the game
  loads it with no "save file is corrupted" message.
- **Icons** (`RomMonIcons`): read from the player's ROM *file* with the companion's own decoder
  (`decodeMonIcon`, shared with `DecompIconSource`) and the icon tables the companion already has: retail
  FireRed rev 0 / 1 and Emerald by whole-file SHA-1, the other retail games by game code + revision
  (`TelemetrySampler.otherRetailConfig`), each checked against the file first. Hacks get names only.
- **TRADE** (PC BOXES > TRADE, `Gen3Trade`, `TradeScreen`): two saves' boxes side by side; a slot on each side is a
  swap or a send. The rules are the games' (pret's `trade.c` / `link.c`): FireRed / LeafGreen link with R/S/E only
  with `FLAG_SYS_CAN_LINK_WITH_RS`; before its National Dex (`IsNationalPokedexEnabled`: magic, var and flag) a
  FireRed / LeafGreen / Emerald neither sends nor takes an egg or a species outside its regional dex (Kanto's 151 /
  Hoenn's 202 - Ruby / Sapphire's own code doesn't check, and a trade with FR / LG / E gives them the National Dex,
  `EnableNationalPokedex`); Mew / Deoxys need the fateful-encounter ribbon bit; mail and the Enigma Berry stay home.
  After a trade, what the game does: the received species seen in all three copies and caught
  (`UpdatePokedexForReceivedMon`; Unown / Spinda keep the first one's personality), trade evolutions
  (`gEvolutionTable`'s EVO_TRADE / EVO_TRADE_ITEM, Everstone stops them, the item is used up, an unnicknamed one is
  renamed - `EvolutionRenameMon` - so only English games evolve on arrival: other languages would rename it to their
  own word), asked first like the game's evolution scene. Both saves are written by `SaveFileEdits.writeBoth`: the
  partner first, and put back if the second write fails. The tables a save on its own can't read from a ROM (National
  / Hoenn Dex numbers, trade evolutions, a few item ids) are `SpeciesDexGen.kt`, from `scripts/gen_species_dex.py`
  over `$DECOMPS/pokeemerald`. Offsets of flags / vars / the seen copies per format come from the decomps' global.h.
- **Editing values** (`Gen3SaveEditor`, the BAG page and the detail pane's ITEM / move rows, `SaveBagScreen.kt`): only what
  the game could hold, from `Gen3Legal` over `SaveTablesGen.kt` (`scripts/gen_save_tables.py`, pokeruby / pokeemerald /
  pokefirered: per family the items each pocket takes - no key items, "????????" or Enigma Berry - each species' level-up
  learnset, TM / HM and tutor bits, and pre-evolutions). Money 0..999,999 and coins 0..9,999, XORed with SaveBlock2's
  encryption key like `SetMoney` / `SetCoins` (none on R/S); bag quantities XOR the key's low half (`SetBagItemQuantity`;
  PC items aren't), up to `AddBagItem`'s stack size (FR/LG 999, R/S/E 99 and berries 999; an HM 1). Pockets are written
  packed, TMs and berries in id order; key items and HMs are shown but never changed or removed (the game hands them out
  once). Held items: any bag item but HMs and mail. Moves: 1-4 different ones, each already known or one the species - or
  what it evolved from - learns by its level, by TM / HM or from the game's tutors (FR/LG add Cape Brink's three starter
  moves; Smeargle gets every move but Struggle). Egg / event moves stay if known but aren't offered. A kept move keeps its
  PP and PP Ups; a new one gets full base PP (`gBattleMoves`, `MoveStatsGen.kt`) and none. `Gen3SaveEditTest` covers them.
- **Look at it**: `cd ui-preview && gradle render -Ponly=pc-boxes,trade` (made-up saves, `SyntheticSave.demoFireRed` /
  `demoTrade`, with stand-in dots for icons - no game art in the repo); `PcBoxesScreenshotTest` for Paparazzi.

## WIDE (ASPECT > EXPAND)

SETTINGS > ASPECT > EXPAND (`GameAspect.WIDE` / WIDE in the code and prefs; renamed on screen once it also went
up and down on phones) fills a wide screen with the game at full height and square pixels: the middle is the
game's own 240x160 frame, the strips beside it (22 GBA px per side on the Thor's 1920x1080) are the overworld,
rebuilt every frame from the game's memory by `app/src/main/cpp/pk_wide.c`. A wider PPU can't do it: the field
only keeps a 256x256 ring of tiles in VRAM (`field_camera.c`), so the rest would be wrap-around garbage.

- **What it draws from**: the map grid in `VMap` (the map + 7 metatiles of stitched connections per side); past
  that, the connected maps' own cells from the ROM (`gMapHeader.connections`, the inverse of `fieldmap.c`'s
  `Fill*Connection`), else the border. Metatiles from the layout's tilesets (ROM), drawn as `DrawMetatile` does
  (BG1 top / BG2 middle / BG3 bottom by layer type; FireRed names its buffers misleadingly: `gBGTilemapBuffers2`
  is BG1). Pixels from VRAM and palette RAM, so animated tiles and fades are the game's. Sprites: `gSprites` in
  `gSpriteOrder` with subsprites and semi-transparent blending, like `BuildOamBuffer`; NPCs the game hid only for
  being more than 16 px off screen (`ObjectEvent.offScreen`) are shown - they stay loaded ~2 metatiles out.
- **Timing**: the main loop computes frame N while N-1 is on screen and the VBlank handler uploads it, so the RAM
  after frame N-1 describes the frame now drawn: `pk_wide.c` keeps that snapshot. When a step's row redraw runs the
  main loop past VBlank, a snapshot is caught mid-update (pos moved, the ring offsets not yet). So the camera comes
  from the BG scroll registers the frame was drawn with (mGBA's `memory.io`: write-only, open bus on a bus read)
  plus the ring's anchor from RAM, and every candidate (both snapshots, pos +-1 metatile) is scored against the
  frame's own BG1-3 tilemaps in VRAM; the sprite list must match the frame's OAM, else the last good one is kept.
- **Off the map: ambient edges.** Anything that doesn't check out - not mode 0 with BG1-3 on, windows hiding a layer
  at the screen's edges (a Flash-dark cave, a battle transition), under 90% of the tilemap matching (title, menu
  screens, battles) - crossfades the strips (16 frames) from the last map strips, frozen, to a glow spread from the
  game's own edge columns (`ambientEdges`): each strip column takes its row's colour from the 12-px edge band,
  blurred over more rows the further out it is, from full brightness at the game's edge to ~47% at the screen's,
  smoothed over frames so text passing the edge doesn't flicker it. It follows whatever the game shows (the title's
  flames, a battle's sky, flashes and fades) and invents nothing. Back on the map it crossfades to the map strips.
  The map strips also take BLDCNT's brightness fades (BLDY), not only palette ones.
- **Battles are wide too.** The battle background (BG3, `battle_bg.c`'s template: char base 2, screen base 26, a
  64x32 tilemap) is 512 px wide in VRAM - sky, terrain and both platforms all the way across - so with
  `gMain.inBattle` (bit 1 of `gMain + 0x439`) set and BG3 in that layout, the strips are what a wider PPU would draw:
  BG3 from VRAM, the frame's real OAM where sprites reach past the edges (affine ones too, with mGBA's own transform
  math: the battlers), windows continued past the edges (the opening band spans the whole width), blending and
  brightness. BG0-2 (text, menus, animations) aren't drawn past 240; where BG3 is transparent (the text box rows)
  the strip goes on with the game's own edge pixel of that row - the solid dark band the text box and menus sit on
  (the glow there looked muddy, the user's call). Per-scanline registers: games rewrite scroll / windows between lines (the intro's sliding
  halves), so a hook on mGBA's `drawScanline` copies DISPCNT..BLDY as each line is drawn (it runs at HBlank's start,
  before that HBlank's DMA writes the next line's values). Checked like the map: captured with only BG3 + OBJ on
  (`layers 0x18`), the rebuild of the middle matched every battle frame of both games pixel for pixel - intro slide,
  send-out, menu, RUN, exit.
- **Line by line, on the map too.** The map rebuild draws each scanline with its own registers (the `drawScanline`
  hook): layer enables, windows and scroll (a line scrolled apart from the latched value - a transition's slices - is
  that much further along the map), and the camera score samples them the same way. So battle-start wedges and
  Flash's dark circle are drawn as the game draws them, and a pixel the windows leave without a map layer is a hole
  that continues the row's edge pixel (dark caves stay dark to the screen's edges). Sprites: affine ones are drawn
  (mGBA's transform), and screen-space sprites (not following the camera) wrap like OAM's 9 / 8-bit positions.
  Blending and brightness are done on the widened 8-bit colour, as mGBA's 32-bit renderer does, so they round alike.
- **Weather** is screen-space sprites (`GFXTAG_*` 0x1201-0x1206: fog, ash, sandstorm, bubbles, rain) laid only over the
  game's 240 px - fog / ash / sandstorm as 64 px grids, rain at random - so each is drawn again 256 px either way, in
  the margins only: it goes on seamlessly however wide the screen.
- **The sweep** (both games, `mgba_dump` with BG0 off so text boxes and popups don't count): warp in with the game's
  own `warp` script command (`0x39 group num warpId x y`), walk a loop with `widecheck` on. Pixel-exact on every map
  frame in towns, forests, lit and Flash-dark caves, gyms, fog (Lost Cave), shade (Berry Forest, Abandoned Ship),
  ash (Route 113, Mt. Chimney), rain (Routes 119, 120), sandstorm route, Seafoam, Meteor Falls. Known leftovers, all
  in the middle and never seen in the margins: a door's opening animation (drawn into VRAM, not the map data -
  arriving by warp shows one), the Pokémon Mansion's top line while the camera is at the map's top edge (the game's
  own stale tile row), a diving bubble a pixel off underwater, and Granite Cave B1F's Flash circle for the frames it
  fades back in after a battle.
- **Transitions, recorded**: `mgba_dump`'s `widerec` records every wide frame; `scripts/wide_gif.py` makes a GIF or a
  contact sheet. Checked on both games: boot (intro, title, Continue, FireRed's recap) to the map, and map -> a
  scripted wild battle (`setwildbattle` / `dowildbattle` / `end` poked at `0x0203FF00`, `call
  ScriptContext_SetupScript`: FireRed rev 1 `0x08069AF9`, Emerald `0x08098EF9`) -> RUN -> map.
- **One motion per event** (`pk_wide_scene`, `WideCamera`): the camera no longer reacts to what's already on screen.
  pk_wide.c says what the frame *is* a frame early - FIELD, TEXT (controls locked + a text box / line effect), OVERLAY
  (a picture on BG0 over most of the field), BATTLE_START (battle_transition.c's `sTransitionData` is set:
  `PK_WIDE_TRANSITION_PTR`, found in the decomp ELF, checked in retail headless - non-null from the first flash to the
  wipe's end) or OFF (a battle, a menu) - and the camera runs one timed ease-in-out in log space per change of target:
  a text box or menu pulls in over 0.42 s, a battle over 0.55 s (its flashes last ~0.8 s, so it's over before the
  wipe slides anything), the way back out takes 0.65 s after the usual half-second delay. `WideCameraTest` checks the
  pull-in never jumps and eases both ends.
- **FireRed's map preview** (entering Viridian Forest, Mt. Moon...: `map_preview_screen.c` draws a picture on BG0 over
  the field while the new map sits under it, so the margins showed the new map around a boxed picture): OVERLAY is BG0
  covering >= 300 of the screen's 600 tiles in >= 11 full-width tile rows one after another (`OVERLAY_ROWS`: the picture
  is one block 14 rows tall; the START menu's SAVE screen covers as many tiles but in windows that never make more than
  a text box's 6 full rows - and Gen 3 draws window text as unique tiles, so counting distinct tiles can't tell them
  apart: it dimmed the SAVE screen once; Unbound's full-screen START menu and its save prompt make 11 full rows, but as
  two bars above and below the field, and dimmed it until the rows had to be one block - GitHub #86). Only the FireRed
  engine has the map preview (`mapPreviews`: the FR / FR_EX families), and never while a battle transition runs:
  SoulGold's item description over its message box and a trainer's mugshot sliding in passed as one, and since
  SoulGold keeps the window registers on, mGBA's output carries no layer tags there, so its windows went dark with
  the field (GitHub #100). While it's up the map around the picture is dimmed - the frame's own pixels that aren't BG0's
  and all of the margins - ramping over ~11 frames (`OVERLAY_DIM`) and then following the card's own alpha blend as
  the game fades it out (`overlayStrength`: BLDALPHA's first weight while BG0 is the first target), so the map comes
  back exactly as the card goes (it once stayed dark until the card's tiles were gone, then brightened in a step).
  The camera holds its zoom for the card (OVERLAY decides nothing, like FADE): a pull-in and a zoom back out around a
  two-second card was motion for nothing.
- **A warp holds the zoom** (`fadedFrame`): between two maps (a door, a connection building) the screen is black for a
  few frames with no map to check, which used to read as OFF - the camera pulled in to 1x and zoomed back out on the
  other side. A frame that's all black (or all white) outside a battle is FADE, whatever the map check or the menu
  check made of it (one black frame mid-warp passed as a menu screen): the camera changes nothing on it - neither the
  pull-in nor the way back out starts on a black screen (the boot's long black screens would have zoomed out unseen
  and pulled in on the title).
- **AUTO ZOOM IN** (SETTINGS, under ASPECT, only while ASPECT is EXPAND; `Prefs.expandZoomOnText`, ON by default;
  `WideCamera.zoomOnText`): OFF keeps the chosen zoom through conversations, signs, the START menu and menu screens (`PK_WIDE_SCENE_MENU`, a menu screen's own scene value so the option can leave it alone -
  its margins are the menu's back layer); a battle's start, a battle and the title still pull in - and so does a menu
  screen opened from a battle (POKéMON / BAG: `gMain.inBattle` stays set, so pk_wide.c reports it as the battle,
  `PK_WIDE_SCENE_OFF`, not `_MENU` - the party screen used to zoom out mid-battle and the battle zoom back in after it).
- **Leaving a building holds the zoom** (`textUp`, `POPUP_ROWS` / `POPUP_COLS`): the game locks the controls for the
  walk out of the door while the map-name popup is up (even Pallet Town's after the player's house), which read as a
  text box for ~80 frames - a pull-in and a zoom back out at every door. The popup's corner of BG0 (the top-left 14 x
  5 tiles, every Gen 3 game draws it there) doesn't count towards a text box; checked headless walking out of the
  player's house: FADE through the black, FIELD after.
- **"Previously on your quest" stays at 1x** (`questLogPlaying`, `PK_WIDE_QUEST_LOG` = FireRed's `gQuestLogState`, 2 /
  3 through the replay, checked headless on retail rev 1): the recap replays the field with scripted text boxes coming
  and going, which zoomed the camera in and out several times; it's OFF for the camera until the field is the
  player's, and the chosen step comes back half a second after that.
- **Borders past a neighbour's end** (`blockIn`): beyond the stitched strip, a point beside the current map but past
  the span of the neighbour on that side gets the current map's border, as the strip itself shows - not the
  neighbour's (Celadon City's trees above Route 16, where Route 16's sea border once drew a block with straight edges).
- **Tried and dropped (2026-10-12)**: replacing the battle background (BG3) with the place the battle started - the
  overworld around the player captured sprite-free as the transition begins, shown as a mip-filtered or crisp Mode 7
  floor under a sky in the terrain's colours, as a floor in whole scales, flat at 1:1 / 2:1, or as a stage strip of
  the map's rows between the game's own sky and ground. All ten looked wrong to the user (top-down map art never
  reads as a place behind side-view battlers), so none of it is in the code. Two findings from it worth keeping:
  mGBA's 32-bit output tags every pixel with its layer in the top byte (`FLAG_PRIORITY` / `FLAG_INDEX` /
  `FLAG_IS_BACKGROUND`: the backdrop has every flag set, a blended or covered pixel none - `fromBg`), which is how a
  frame's own pixels can be edited per layer (the OVERLAY dim uses it); and the platforms in a terrain's BG3 are the
  tiles its tilemap uses at most ~6 times (sky and ground repeat theirs along the row).
- **Games**: every retail FireRed, LeafGreen, Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire the user owns (English, Japanese, Spanish,
  German, French, Italian; every revision): `app/src/main/cpp/pk_wide_games.h`, one row of addresses per ROM by CRC32, generated by
  `scripts/gen_wide_tables.py <roms dirs>` from the English references (FireRed rev 1, Emerald: from the decomp ELFs,
  mapped onto retail through the literal pools - only FireRed's `VMap` / `gSaveBlock1Ptr` differ; Ruby
  rev 1: pret/pokeruby's `ruby_rev1` ELF, byte-identical to retail) through
  each ROM's literal pools (`port_retail.py`'s `map_literal`). Retail only, by the SHA-1s the app lists (GameTitles,
  RetailPortsGen): hacks share the game codes but move addresses. `gMapGroups` gets one pool vote,
  so it's also checked by the shapes of the maps it leads to. Each engine's layout (metatiles, attributes, border) is
  `pk_wide.c`'s `FAMILIES`. Ruby / Sapphire are Emerald's layout with their own quirks: `gSaveBlock1` is static (no
  pointer), `gSpriteCoordOffsetY` isn't next to X, `gMain.inBattle` is at +0x43D, and a `struct Subsprite` is 8 bytes
  (u16 x, y + the bits, padded to 4 by agbcc - the menu cursor's RAM table showed it); Japanese R/S keep
  FireRed / Emerald's gMain and 4-byte subsprites (`PK_WIDE_FAMILY_RS_JA`). Kotlin asks native (`WideScreen.gameFor` -> `pkWideKnows`); a game WIDE doesn't know shows
  as ORIGINAL (the companion's pick-list tags WIDE NOT YET). `scripts/verify_wide.py` boots every ROM in the table
  headless with its save and checks a walk (BG0 off) and a scripted battle (BG3 + OBJ) frame by frame - all 82 in the
  table pass (build/wide/verify.md; a hack marked `pending` is checked too - its row is under `PK_WIDE_PENDING`, which only
  verify_wide.py's build defines - but the app doesn't have it). Rerun both after
  touching pk_wide.c.
- **ROM hacks** (`HACKS` in `gen_wide_tables.py`, by SHA-1, each with its host_roms.conf save and any boot presses):
  - *CFRU* (Unbound, its French build, Radical Red) keep FireRed rev 0's RAM and code, so their addresses map through the
    literal pools like a retail port's; only `gMapGroups` is overridden (the app's GuideTables value - Unbound repoints it
    and XORs its entries with 0x00B749DE: `MAP_GROUPS_XOR`). Unbound's DrawMetatile writes 0 to BG3 under a NORMAL
    metatile where retail writes 0x3014 (`NORMAL_BG3`), and its snow lives in world space, relying on OAM's 9 / 8-bit wrap
    (a flake at y -232 shows at 24): world sprites are wrapped like the PPU does wherever that lands on the real screen
    (`hardwareWrap`), except NPCs we show past the edge on purpose.
  - *Binary FireRed hacks* (Odyssey, Gaia, Amethyst 1.3.0, Celia, Sword and Shield Ultimate Plus, GS Chronicles - its primary
    tilesets 512 metatiles, `PRIMARY_OVERRIDE` -, Ultra Violet - under
    its own game code PUVV -, FireRed Rocket Edition and Ash Gray, both booted with retail FireRed's save) and *binary Emerald hacks* (Glazed, Emerald Kaizo - booted with retail Emerald's save -, Super Mariomon, whose RAM sits 0x80 lower from the
    sprites on: `sSpriteOrder` from find_wide_addrs.py) map through the literal pools the same way, `gMapGroups` from the
    app's GuideTables. Super Mariomon 1.3 / 1.2.x boot the 1.5.1 save cut to their SaveBlock1 (`trim_save_block1.py`).
  - *pokeemerald-expansion* (Lazarus, SoulGold's four builds, Seaglass, Imperium, Rogue, Heart and Soul, Too Many Types 2;
    `PK_WIDE_FAMILY_EX`) and *Recharged Yellow* (a gcc pokefirered: FireRed's map and triple-layer metatiles with
    expansion's objects, `PK_WIDE_FAMILY_FR_EX`): gcc builds share no code with retail,
    so `scripts/find_wide_addrs.py` finds each address in headless dumps (boot, a step right, a step down: VMap by the
    layout's size, the camera by HOFS / tile offsets, gSprites by the OAM, the coord offsets from the player's sprite,
    sSpriteOrder as a permutation). Expansion moved `ObjectEvent.spriteId` to +0x23 (graphicsId is a u16). Both hacks use
    triple-layer metatiles - 24 bytes, BG3 / BG2 / BG1 (`METATILE_SIZE`) - and SoulGold 11-bit metatile ids with 1024
    primary metatiles (`METATILE_MASK`, `PRIMARY_OVERRIDE`). gcc places the camera pans where it likes (`PAN_OFF`: +8 in
    agbcc builds and Lazarus, -4 in SoulGold, 12 in Heart and Soul). Heart and Soul keeps SaveBlock1's pos 4 bytes in
    (`SB1_POS`; find_wide_addrs.py's `--pos`) and mixes layouts: its own (MapLayout +0x18 = 2) split the primary tileset
    at 640 metatiles like FireRed, the Emerald ones it kept (0) at 512 (`LAYOUT_VERSIONED`: the split is per snapshot,
    `syncSplit`). Its boot is `rhh_splash.txt` (`boot_file`: default.txt's A presses talk to the follower). Rogue's
    gMapGroups came from its save: the current map's header in ROM -> its group's array -> the table.
  - *Pending* (mapped, checked, not in the app): Orange Islands (the top row, half the walk), Quetzal (its own SaveBlock1,
    pos 0x470 in: most map frames differ), R.O.W.E. (12-bit metatile ids - `METATILE_MASK` 0xFFF, elevation in the top
    nibble - and a 2048-metatile primary tileset get its map found, `NUM_METATILES_TOTAL` 4096; one NPC's sprite and a
    building's metatiles still differ).
  - *The game's own stale edge*: Sword and Shield's "performance" builds (and Amethyst 1.4.1 once) don't draw the tile
    column scrolling in until a whole tile has - the real frame shows the ring's old tiles there and the rebuild the map.
    `widecheck` doesn't count a frame whose differences all lie inside the partly shown edge tile column / row of BG1's
    scroll (`x >= 240 - (HOFS & 7)` or `x < 8 - (HOFS & 7)`, the same for rows), and says so.
- **Transitions that slide lines** (Unbound's wild battle start): the latched scroll is only the last line's, and the
  lines slide both ways around the camera, so the camera's own scroll is also taken from RAM (sFieldCameraOffset +
  sHorizontal / sVerticalCameraPan + 8, as FieldUpdateBgTilemapScroll writes it) and scored as a candidate. On the real
  screen a slid line shows the 256-px ring wrapped around (the map where it holds the camera's view, leftover tiles past
  it - which the next frame may already have redrawn, so those pixels are the real frame's); the margins show the map
  slid along. `mgba_dump`'s `wideinfo lines` prints each line's scroll.
- **The window** (`WideCamera`, `pk_wide_view`): pk_wide.c draws any rectangle around the frame - beside, above,
  below, or one the frame only partly covers (rows past the screen take its edge line's registers; holes go on with
  the frame's nearest edge pixel; the glow spreads from all four edges). Before each frame the engine asks
  `EmulatorView.camera` for the window (`pkWideSetView`), and `publishFrame` hands the GL thread the drawn window with
  where it goes: whole GBA pixels drawn, the quad offset by the fraction (`WideCamera.Window.offX` / `offY`), so zoom
  and look glide instead of stepping. Up to 800x800 (`PK_WIDE_MAX_VIEW_W` / `_H`). Savestate thumbnails stay 240x160.
- **ZOOM** (the ZOOM hotkey: R3 - the right stick's click, which used to be SLOT NEXT - or C on a keyboard): steps out from 1x (the game at the view's full height) to
  whole screen pixels per GBA pixel showing >= 1.2x more each (`WideCamera.levelsFor`: the Thor's 6.75 -> 5 / 4 / 3,
  ~1.35x / 1.7x / 2.25x the map). It eases back to 1x whenever `pk_wide_wants_close`: not on the map (battles, menu
  screens) or the field's controls locked (`CONTROLS_LOCKED`: sLockFieldControls / sScriptContext2Enabled - every game
  in the table: the decomp ELFs for retail, the Lock / Unlock / ArePlayerFieldControlsLocked trio for the gcc builds,
  and for Recharged Yellow, whose lock is inlined, the byte that's 1 under a scripted message and 0 through the test walk) with BG0 showing a text box / menu or lines drawn apart (a
  transition) - a warp's fade or the map-name popup don't. The step comes back 0.5 s after. NPCs only exist ~2 tiles
  past the game's own view, so far out they pop in as you near them.
- **Unbound lags at its map borders by itself**: walking near a connection it drops a frame every step, and 3-4 at
  the crossing (headless: sFieldCameraOffset not moving for a frame while LEFT is held, on mGBA with no app around it;
  in the middle of a city one every ~80 frames). The app's pacing stays at 60 fps through it (`fps=` lines, late 0),
  with EXPAND on or off - it's the game's own map loading, as on hardware or RetroArch's mGBA core.
- **An undefined cell is exactly 0x3FF** (`blockIn`): the game's MapGridGetMetatileIdAt compares the whole u16 with
  MAPGRID_UNDEFINED, so a map's own metatile 0x3FF with collision / elevation bits (Unbound's treetop corners, 0x33FF) is
  drawn, not the border. Masked first, those cells came out as Unbound's border (water squares over the trees).
- **Connected maps, zoomed out** (`readConnections`, `blockIn`, `foreignFor`): the game copies 7 metatiles of each
  neighbour into VMap and draws them with the current map's tilesets; past that, a neighbour may have tilesets of its
  own (FireRed's Route 18 is Celadon's, Fuchsia City its own), so off the real frame each connected map - its VMap strip
  too - is drawn with its own: metatiles, tiles LZ77-decompressed from the ROM (cached, 4 tileset pairs, never replaced
  mid-frame), palettes from the ROM; what it shares with the current map stays VRAM / palette RAM. On the real frame,
  exactly as the game. Neighbours' neighbours are drawn too (Route 20 from Fuchsia City), and where no map is, the border
  of the neighbour on that side - so the scenery doesn't change as you cross. Their object templates (from their headers)
  are ghosts as well, unless the current map has a clone of them.
- **Fast-forward** draws one window per ~12 ms (`EmulatorEngine.WIDE_DRAW_NANOS`, `pkWideSetDraw`): FF runs several
  frames per screen refresh and only one is seen; the rest only keep the RAM after them (`pk_wide_skip`) and aren't
  published. At 4x zoomed out it had the emulation thread at 100% of a core (the Thor ran hot, 174 fps of 240); now ~35%.
- **Far-off objects** (`takeGhosts` / `drawGhosts`; `OBJ_GFX_INFO` and friends - the decomp ELFs' statics for retail
  FireRed / Emerald / Ruby, mapped to every language and checked by content in gen_wide_tables.py, since the graphics
  table gets one pool vote; `scripts/find_wide_objects.py` for gcc builds, from a fixture's live objects): the game spawns object events only ~2 tiles past its own view, so zoomed out a cuttable tree,
  a boulder, an item ball or an NPC wasn't there until you neared it. Every template the save holds for the map
  (`SaveBlock1.objectEventTemplates`: home tiles, a boulder where Strength left it) that isn't hidden by its flag or
  already spawned is drawn from the ROM's graphics (`gObjectEventGraphicsInfoPointers`, its movement type's first
  facing), where SpawnObjectEvent would put it, in its palette slot if loaded (fades, tints) else the ROM's palette, behind
  every real sprite. An object the game has removed is drawn where it was last seen live, facing the way it faced
  (`rememberObjects` / `seenFind`): the game removes one once both its tile and its home are ~2 tiles past its own view
  and spawns it again at its home, so drawn from its template a wandering NPC jumped home the moment it went (zoomed
  out, in plain sight). It still jumps home when the game spawns it again, as in the game; the memory is per map and
  goes with a warp (the map no longer current or beside it) or a reset. A template whose object is still live - the
  map you just crossed from keeps its objects until they leave the view - isn't drawn either (it was a double at home).
  Never on the real frame (the game shows what's there), and only with an NPC palette from the ROM's table - Lazarus's
  lamp lights are templates too (palette tag 0x8001, shown by the game as blended glows), which drew over the real
  glows. A ROM palette is tinted as the game tinted its loaded ones (`measureTint`: palette RAM vs the ROM, per channel,
  darkening only): SoulGold's night, a fade. CFRU's ids are 16-bit (`OBJ_GFX_TABLES`: template byte 3 picks a table,
  0xFF a var; Unbound, Radical Red, Amethyst, Orange Islands, Sword and Shield), expansion's too (`TEMPLATE_KIND` 3:
  graphicsId at +1, kind at +3; ids past `OBJ_GFX_VAR_FROM` + 16 are overworld Pokémon, not drawn). Unbound's palette
  table runs on past an empty entry (0x1200s after 0x1100s); `romPalette` caches 64 tags. Each hack's SaveBlock1 is its
  own (`SB1_OFFSETS`; Recharged Yellow keeps its flags before its templates: `SB1_FLAGS_AT`); `mgba_dump`'s `wideghosts`
  lists them and the connected maps they come from, `NO PALETTE` where neither source has one.
  A template's flag is read the way the game's FlagGet reads it: past SaveBlock1's own array the engine reads on into
  the block (Odyssey's and Glazed's high flags live there), but CFRU's GetFlagPointer (Unbound, Radical Red, Amethyst,
  Sword and Shield) keeps 0x900-0x18FF in its own bank (`EXPANDED_FLAGS`, 0x0203B174) and 0x1900-0x3FFF on one byte
  (0x020370B8) - read from the save block, Unbound's hidden NPCs (a police officer beside a Pokémon Center) showed in
  the margins and vanished as you walked up. Special flags (0x4000 on) count as hidden. To look at a reported spot,
  pull the app's `states/<crc>/resume` and `mgba_dump`'s `loadstate` it, then `wideghosts` / `wideshot`.
  A template outside its own map isn't drawn (Too Many Types 2 parks cutscene trucks at y -1). The graphics tables of the
  gcc builds run into other data past their end, so each has its length (`OBJ_GFX_COUNT`): Rogue 0x269, Heart and Soul
  0x224, Too Many Types 2 0x10D, Recharged Yellow 0x159 (its code: ids to 0x158, vars from 0x15A, Pokémon from 0x200);
  where a game's var ids aren't known, `OBJ_GFX_VAR_FROM` 0xFFFF leaves them undrawn rather than guessed. Rogue's
  templates hold graphicsId at +2 (`TEMPLATE_KIND_AT` 1). find_wide_objects.py takes several dumps (a walk dumped every
  step: more live objects to vote). With no palette tag list (or none loaded) the tint comes from the map: BG palette RAM
  against the tilesets' colours in ROM.
- **Torn frames**: a lag frame can change palette RAM or OAM while it's drawn (Recharged Yellow's and Rogue's battle-exit
  fade, Seaglass's healthboxes), so the scanline hook keeps a copy of each whenever a line's differs from the last
  (`linePalBuf` / `lineOamBuf`, up to 8 a frame) and every line is drawn with its own (`useLine` sets the registers `R`
  and the palette `P`; a battle's sprites draw each OAM on its own lines). VRAM written mid-frame (a tile upload) can't
  be redrawn from anything taken after the frame: `pk_wide_last_vram_torn` reports it, and `widecheck` doesn't count
  such a frame. Brightness is mGBA's per channel in place (white darkened by 1 is 240, 239, 239: Imperium's flash), and
  a window's effects bit holds in battles too.
- **Menu screens** (`PK_WIDE_MODE_MENU`, `drawMenuRegion`): instead of the glow, the back BG layer goes on past the
  edges, each row repeating the pattern found along its edge (`menuPeriod`: the smallest 8..32 px that repeats); a row
  whose edge doesn't (a button reaching it) borrows the nearest row that does, so stripes and frames carry on without
  copying any text or panel. Mode 0 / 1 tiled screens; anything else still glows.
- **Never a crash**: every read goes through bounds-checked helpers and every index is clamped; sizes from memory are
  bounded before they're multiplied; `_Static_assert`s keep the config rows in step with the slots. On top, `pk_wide_view`
  runs under a fault guard (SIGSEGV / SIGBUS / SIGFPE / SIGILL on its thread while drawing jump back out; WIDE switches
  itself off for the game - `pk_wide_fault` -> `MgbaCore.pkWideFault` -> a HUD notice - and the plain frame shows); a
  fault anywhere else goes on to the handler before it. The camera, the frame hand-off and the GL placement each catch
  and fall back. `mgba_dump`'s `widefuzz N SEED` throws random windows and random bytes / pointers at the RAM WIDE reads;
  built with `-fsanitize=address,undefined -DPK_WIDE_NO_GUARD` it ran 33,000 frames over six games (map and menus) clean,
  and since the far-off objects went to every engine (it also hits SaveBlock1's templates / flags / vars and the palette
  tag list) 66,000 more over eleven: retail Emerald and Ruby, Unbound, Radical Red, Amethyst, Lazarus, SoulGold, Seaglass,
  Rogue, Heart and Soul, Recharged Yellow.
- **Telling players** (`ExpandIntro`): once on the Library for anyone not on EXPAND (`Prefs.expandIntroSeen`; after
  first-time setup), and once more on the companion the first time a game EXPAND knows opens while it's still off
  (`Prefs.expandGameOfferSeen`, `CompanionSettings.expandOffer`) - "NOT NOW" on the Library doesn't stop that one, but
  any answer to it settles both. TURN ON sets ASPECT > EXPAND. ui-preview: `library-expand-intro`, `*-expand-offer`.
- **A phone upright** (`PortraitPanel.expand`, `GameStageLayout.expand`, `PortraitLayout.arrange(expand)`): the game
  takes everything above the companion (COMPANION's AT BOTTOM / UNDER GAME land in the same place then) and the touch
  pad lies over it; 1x is the frame at the view's full width (`levelsFor` takes the smaller fit), so the window goes
  on above and below it (a 1080-wide phone: 4.5 -> 3 / 2).
- **Look-around** (the right stick, AXIS_Z / RZ or RX / RY): standing, it moves the view and leaves it there; walking
  (a direction held) glides it back - with the stick held while walking it follows the stick, the player kept 28 px
  inside. Checked headless with `mgba_dump`'s `wideview X Y W H`.
- **Checks**: `scripts/widescreen_proto.py` is the Python original (reads `mgba_dump` captures). The C is checked
  headless with `mgba_dump`'s `wideon` / `widecheck` / `widestats` (`native-capture/README.md`): it rebuilds the
  middle 240x160 too and compares it with the real frame. Walking, running and NPCs moving, every frame matched
  pixel for pixel on both games (2026-10-09). Not covered yet: weather drawn over the field (rain sprites, fog on
  BG0) stops at the GBA's edges; scanline effects aren't extended.

## Overlays

SCREEN > OVERLAY (both screens' Settings; `Prefs.overlay`, a `OverlayChoice.key`: `""` none - the
default -, `builtin:DAISY` / `builtin:BEZEL`, `user:<folder>`) draws a frame around the game on the top
screen. The code is `overlay/Overlays.kt` (plain Kotlin: parsing, the window finder, placement, the
built-in frames, storage + import - ui-preview compiles it, `OverlaysTest` covers it),
`overlay/OverlayBitmaps.kt` (decoding) and `EmulatorView` (drawing).

- **Nothing third-party is bundled**: the common console borders show the console maker's logo and
  shell, so the app ships only its own two frames and players import what they already have. Docs
  and the site may point at libretro's overlay collections in general, never at a branded file, and
  screenshots only ever show the built-in frames.
- **Built-in frames** (`BuiltInFrames`): DAISY (the launcher icon's blue, the website's dot grid, a dark
  screen surround, the PokeDaisy mark in the left margin) and BEZEL (plain charcoal). Drawn at the game's
  own pixel size for the view they're shown on and drawn at a whole-number scale (`scaleFor`: the
  largest that leaves 8 frame pixels at the sides, 4 above and below - 6x on the Thor's 1920x1080,
  7x for a Game Boy), so they're as crisp as the game; the game loses a little size (6x instead of 6.75x).
- **Imports** (top-screen Settings > OVERLAY > IMPORT FILE, several files at once): RetroArch's overlay
  `.cfg` (`overlays = N`, `overlayK_overlay` = its image, `overlayK_viewport` = "x,y,w,h" in 0..1
  where the game goes; touch-button entries ignored), a `.zip` of those (images found by their path
  inside it, `__MACOSX` / dot files skipped, 96 MB unpacked at most, 64 overlays per import) and bare PNGs.
  With any `.cfg` in an import, only its images come in: a pack's other PNGs (button art, previews) aren't overlays
  (they once each became one); a PNG is an overlay by itself only when no `.cfg` was picked with it.
  A `.cfg`'s image is looked for among the picked files, then beside its real path (with All files
  access), else the page asks for it (PICK THE IMAGE). Each overlay becomes a folder under
  `<external files>/overlays/` - its PNGs renamed `0.png`, `1.png`... and the `.cfg` rewritten to match,
  plus `pokedaisy_name`. PNG only (its window is its alpha); nothing is decoded at import.
- **The window**: the `.cfg`'s viewport, else `OverlayWindow.find` on the decoded image - the see-through
  region (alpha < 128) around the centre, as a rectangle, if it's at least 4% of the image and fills 60%
  of its box (Nosh's GBA bezel in libretro/overlay-borders has no viewport; it's what RetroArch users
  set by hand). No window: the image is a background, drawn behind the game.
- **Placement** (`OverlayGeometry.layout`): the image fitted to the view and centred, filling it when
  their shapes are within 4% (a 16:9 border on 16:9), the game fitted inside the window at its own shape
  (ASPECT > STRETCH fills the window instead). A pack's several overlays (landscape / portrait): the
  one closest to the view's shape (`StoredOverlay.layerFor`). Imports are decoded at the smallest power-of-two
  sample still at least the view's size (a 4K border is 1920x1080 on the Thor) and scaled smoothly; the built-in
  frames are scaled nearest.
- **Drawing** (`EmulatorView.FrameRenderer`): the overlay is a second texture, blended over the game
  (premultiplied, `GL_ONE, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA`) or drawn before it when it's a background; the game's
  quad is its place in the window, so SHADERS' prescale and the companion's grid cell (`onGamePixel`)
  follow the game's real size. With an overlay `GameStageLayout` gives the view all the room under the
  status bar. Off on a phone held upright (`topAligned`), where the game is its own shape across the top.
- **Previews**: `gradle render -Ponly=overlay` in ui-preview draws each built-in frame (Thor, Game Boy,
  half-screen side panel, 4:3) and an import of a drawn wooden frame (window found from alpha) around a
  stand-in game, with the same placement code; `settings-overlay*` / `*-settings-overlay` are the pages.

## Build

```bash
git submodule update --init third_party/mgba third_party/rcheevos   # first time only (or: make submodules)
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug                                        # or: make apk
```

APK: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`. Requires the Android SDK with
NDK `28.2.13676358` and CMake `3.22.1` (both installable via `sdkmanager`).
`make help` lists the other workflows (install, Paparazzi shots, ui-preview,
headless captures).

The generator scripts under `scripts/` and ui-preview's ROM-art rendering read
built pret decomp checkouts (`pokefirered/`, `pokeemerald/`, `pokeruby/`,
`pokehns/`, each built at its pinned commit) from the directory in the
`DECOMPS` environment variable. Machine-local paths go in an untracked
`local.mk`, which the Makefile includes (see `local.mk.example`).

## ScreenScraper and the dual-screen launcher

Game media (box art, screenshots, title screens, wheel logos, fanart, cartridges, videos and the facts: synopsis,
release date, developer, publisher, genre, players, rating) comes from [ScreenScraper](https://www.screenscraper.fr)'s
API v2 (`ScreenScraperClient.kt`). Every call carries two logins:

- **The app's developer account.** ScreenScraper gives these out to software that asks on its forum. They stay out of
  this public repo: put them in the untracked `local.properties`

  ```properties
  screenscraper.devId=...
  screenscraper.devPassword=...
  ```

  (or `SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_ID` / `SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_PASSWORD` in the environment - the release workflow's secrets,
  see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md)). `app/build.gradle.kts` turns them into `BuildConfig` fields; a build without them
  sends empty ones and the sign-in shows what the server answered.
- **The player's own account**, entered in setup, Settings > ScreenScraper or the one-time popup after the update.

A ROM is looked up by its hashes and size (`jeuInfos.php`), then by its library name and then by its base game's title
(`jeuRecherche.php`: hacks are often catalogued by name only). `GameMedia.kt` downloads one file per kind into
`<external files>/media/<rom file name>/` plus `info.json`, picking regions by the cart header's language letter, and
`CoverArtSync` copies the box art over any automatic cover. A game ScreenScraper doesn't know is asked again after a week;
a failed download makes the next pass fetch again.

With a second screen the library is a launcher (`LauncherScreen.kt`): the list on the main screen, the selected game's
media on the second (`LauncherHost.kt`'s Presentation). X swaps them. Keys always reach `LibraryActivity` (the
Presentation forwards them), which drives the selection itself, so the D-pad works on either screen. Check layout changes
with `cd ui-preview && gradle render -Ponly=launcher` (stand-in media, both screens and the swapped arrangement).

To check what ScreenScraper has for every supported game - no ROMs needed, it asks by the SHA-1s `GameTitles` knows, then
by name, then by base game, through the app's own `GameMedia.find` / `save`:

```bash
cd ui-preview
SS_USER=... SS_PASSWORD=... SS_DEV_ID=... SS_DEV_PASSWORD=... gradle sscheck   # -Ponly=unbound,emerald  -Pvideos=true
gradle render -Ponly=launcher -PssMedia=build/sscheck/media                     # the launcher on that real media
```

`build/sscheck/report.md` lists each game: how it matched (HASH / NAME / BASE_GAME), ScreenScraper's name and id, the media
it has and which facts. The downloads and report stay in `build/` (never committed).

## Shared BEST EFFORT matches (Firestore)

Players can share a best-effort match (the companion asks after one; nothing is sent without SHARE):
`BestEffortShare` writes one document to Firestore collection `bestEffortReports` in project `pokedaisy`
through the REST API - `sha1`, `size`, `gameCode`, `revision`, `matchedAs` (a `BestEffort.Candidate` id),
`full`, `off`, `appVersion`. To receive them, once:

1. Firebase console > project `pokedaisy` > Firestore Database > Create database (production mode).
2. From `website/`: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` (`firestore.rules`: create-only, exactly
   those fields, no reads).

Read them in the console. A ROM shared as FULL is a re-hash of a supported version - add its SHA-1 to
`detect()` with that config; PARTIAL ones show which hacks share a supported game's RAM.

## Releasing

See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md): `make bump V=x.y.z`, merge, `make release` (tags
`v<versionName>` on main), and the Release workflow tests, signs and publishes the APK as
`PokeDaisy-<versionName>.apk`. The app compares the tag against its own `versionName` and
ignores drafts and pre-releases, so a test build can go out as a pre-release
(`1.2.0-rc.1`) without reaching users. **Every release must use the same key**: the
updater's APK only installs over a build signed with it.
Either keystore password can be left out of `keystore.properties` and kept in the macOS
Keychain instead (`security add-generic-password -a pokedaisy -s pokedaisy-storePassword -w`,
and `pokedaisy-keyPassword`): the build reads it from there.

Debug builds never auto-check for updates (a release APK can't install over a
debug-signed app); Settings > VERSION still does. Before handing a download to
Android's installer, `AppUpdateFlow.isOurUpdate` checks it is this app's package,
signed with the running app's own certificate and a higher `versionCode` - a
release asset swapped on GitHub can't install as a new app either.

The app's Settings > LICENSES page is `licenses.txt`, joined at build time
(`licensesAsset` in `app/build.gradle.kts`) from NOTICE, LICENSE and each bundled
component's license (`third_party/licenses/` holds the ones without a submodule).
Add a component there when a new library or asset ships in the APK.

## Test on the Thor (Phase 0 acceptance)

```bash
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb shell mkdir -p /sdcard/Android/data/com.pokedaisy.app/files/roms
adb push firered.gba /sdcard/Android/data/com.pokedaisy.app/files/roms/
```

Launch the app; it boots the first `.gba` it finds in that folder. Swap ROMs by
pushing a different file (only one at a time for now). SRAM persists to
`files/saves/<rom>.sav`.

**Phase 0 is done when** vanilla FireRed, vanilla Emerald, and Unbound each boot, play at full speed, and have correct sound.
